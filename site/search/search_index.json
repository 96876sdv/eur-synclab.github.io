Labmembers can introduce information on a certain skill or topic or can help to dive deeper in a topic where most have already some experience with. In this Google sheet we identified skills and topics: - labmembers have some experience or expertise - labmembers want to learn more about As you can see in the sheet, these skills can focus on methods, but also on personal and artistic topics. Ideally, we would work on topics that align with the ambitions of SYNC lab: World-class Science, Open Science, Citizen Science . Since the skills meetings are only one hour a week, most of the times it would be just an introduction to a certain topic. It would be great to go from there and dive deeper in certain topics in smaller groups when interested (e.g., while working on a project together).

Sharing data is becoming the golden standard in science. It enables others to reproduce your results and prevent fraud and honest mistakes in data analysis. Moreover, it enables reuse of your data in new analyses, increasing the impact of your work. Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways: 1. Publish in a data repository For example: - The EUR Data Repository : for publication packages at the EUR - All data and materials accompanying a publication - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets or non-anonymous data - See the publication packages page for more information. - DANS DataverseNL : for publication packages at Leiden University - All data and materials accompanying a publication - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets (max zip file size 10 GB) or non-anonymous data - DANS EASY (Dutch) - For data and materials, not necessarily accompanying a publication - Has deals with the university but still some limitations to the size of the data (max. 100 GB) - Is aimed more at archiving than sharing data - NeuroVault - For group-MRI data (such as t-maps) accompanying a publication - Enables meta-analysis of fMRI-studies - See the NeuroVault page for more information - Open Science Framework - max. 5 GB per file - Keep your data close to all other relevant files in your OSF project - OSF is more aimed at project management than dissemination, read more here - Other general-purpose repositories, such as Zenodo (free up to 50GB), Dryad (not free) or Non-EUR Figshare (free, max 20GB private space and 5GB per file) In all cases, make your data FAIR , see the data management page and take privacy considerations into account. 2. Publish a datapaper You can also publish a dataset in a data journal without the need to add it to a publication. In a datapaper, you describe the data and the methods of collecting them, without the need to analyze them. This will get you a publication out of your data irrespective of whether or not you publish results. This however often (but not always) requires that you make all described data public, because the aim of such publications is to provide access to high quality datasets and to facilitate reuse. Also, most journals have some policy in which repository you should deposit the data accompanying the datapaper. Note that a datapaper will be peer-reviewed just as well as a regular article. See this link for a list of data journals. 3. Via supplementary materials in a published paper This is better than nothing, but not recommended, because this does not adhere to the FAIR principles . Also, there is often a limit to the size or number of supplementary files that a journal can host, limiting the possibilities to publish data. 4. Share case-by-case For data that cannot be shared publicly, you can sometimes still share the data case-by-case. This can be the case: For MRI-data for which you have informed consent from the participants to share. You may not want to publish this publicly because of the sensitive nature of the data, but you can still share the data because you have consent. Of course this also goes for other kinds of sensitive data for which you have consent. For data that does not belong to a publication, data that is too large to share in another way or some other reason Copyright & licences Copyright includes the rights that you automatically get when you create something, such as an article or dataset (although there are differing opinions on whether or not data is the result of a creative endeavor). The copyright on a work will always be yours, except when you explicitly (partially) give it to someone else, such as a publisher.

A data sharing agreement can be set up between the owner of research data and someone with whom data is shared or who will process the data further. Important components of such an agreement are that the receiver of the data will not try to identify the participants and will not share the data with third parties. This leaves a high degree of control for the data owner concerning who has access to the data. When to use a data sharing agreement? The data cannot be made entirely anonymous (i.e., you have pseudonymized data), AND The participant has given explicit informed consent to share their data with other researchers When data can be made entirely anonymous, you do not strictly need a data sharing agreement (although not forbidden of course). When the participant has NOT given explicit informed consent to share their personal data (non-anonymous data), you are legally NOT ALLOWED to share their personal data at all. In the latter case, try to find a way to anonymize the data or do not share the data at all. Who needs to sign the data sharing agreement? Someone with permission to make lawful decisions under the flag of the university has to sign the agreemement. This should in principle be the Scientific Director (\"WD\", Wetenschappelijk Directeur), from BOTH institutes involved. However, the Scientific Director can give permission (\"volmacht\") to others to make those decisions for him/her (e.g., via an email stating this and for how long the permission is given).

Whether you can share your research data with others depends on: 1. The anonymity of your data 2. Who owns your data 3. The infrastructure available to share the data In this chapter, we will go into nr. 1 and talk about the EU privacy law: the General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR Since May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming [AVG]) has been in place to better protect personal data. The most important aspects of the GDPR are: Privacy by Design : build privacy-increasing measures into your study design Privacy by Default : make sure your default settings already improve your participants' privacy Data minimization : Only collect and use personal data necessary for your research goal (data minimization) Legal basis : Make sure there is a legal basis (6 possible) to process (and share) the personal data you collect (e.g., informed consent or public interest more info (Dutch) ) DPIA : Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment whenever you collect (highly) sensitive data, such as names, addresses, race or health data. Inform participants about the goal of the personal data collection and which data you collect. What is personal data? Data is personal when you can identify someone by it, either directly (e.g., name, address) or indirectly (e.g., height, job, income, education). Indirect indicators are personal data if they can identify someone: when it concerns an extreme case (e.g., someone 2.20m tall) when combining data so that they can only be applicable to one person (NB. this can also concern publicly available data) when re-identification is still possible (e.g., with a name-number key conversion file) By law, data is considered identifiable when identification can occur with reasonable (proportionate) effort. Thus, it is not about the hypothetical possibility that data can be linked or combined. Because not everyone has access to the same data, the definition of \"identifiable\" may differ per situation. Important types of data Pseudonymous data : Data that is only identifiable with a key (that still exists). This is the case when after encryption, it is still possible to identify someone, e.g., because the key or the source data still exist. Pseudonymous data are still considered personal data , because the encryption is reversible , thus requiring a legal basis for processing. Special personal data : special sensitive categories of personal data that may be difficult to anonymize, they require additional measures: race or ethnic descent political views religion union membership genetic or biometric data aimed at unique identification health data sexual life and preference criminal records in the Netherlands: Burgerservicenummer (BSN) Anonymous data : Data that are not (re)identifiable anymore: neiher by a name-number key, nor by combining with other publicly available data. Anonymous data are not considered personal data , so processing and sharing this kind of data do not require a legal basis. Anonymizing data General tips Remove identifiers (name, address) Replace identifiers (e.g., date of birth by age or age groups) Use pseudonyms (e.g., participant numbers) Randomize the pseudonyms (participant numbers) Use only the middle range of the data: extreme cases may lead to identification because by definition, there are only few of them Remove the name-participant number key Plan how to anonymize the data up front and keep a log of your procedures Store original data in a safe location Determine whether different measures combined could lead to identification. If needed, consult a privacy officer. Deidentifying MRI-data There is some debate as to whether or not MRI data can be anonymized. One paper, for example, found that brain morphology, although preprocessed, was personally identifiable Takao, Hayashi, & Ohtomo, 2015 . Moreover, it could be argued that, when combining multiple databases, the data may be identifiable in that way as well. Therefore, we do not speak of anonymizing MRI-data, but deidentifying it: MRI-data will always remain pseudonymous at best and therefore require a legal basis before sharing. Anonymize the filenames: replace names with codes Remove the header information (when using hdr and img files, not for nifti files) Deface the MRI-scans if your software does not do that automatically already. We recommend using pydeface , which is implemented in bidsify If you are uncertain whether your data are anonymous, please don't hesitate to contact a privacy officer. Have a look at this MRI data sharing guide for more info! Sharing data under the GDPR Anonymous data can be shared without restriction if they are really anonymous. You may share non-anonymous data only when: You have attained explicit informed consent from the participant to do so (most used legal basis). For special personal data, this consent should be very explicit (\"I agree to share x, y and z\" with A, B and C): there cannot be any doubt about this. See some example sentences and a GDPR version of the Open Brain Consent initiative You reduce the amount of personal data shared to a minimum (data minimization principle) You take the necessary measures to protect your participants' privacy Always write a Data Management Plan (DMP) and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before starting a project with personal data When sharing data with researchers outside of the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland (no GDPR present), make sure that country has an adequacy decision . If the country does not have one, you need to take extra protection measures, such as standard contractual clauses or agreements. In case your data are not anonymous, but you have attained consent and still want to protect your participants' privacy better, you may always use a data sharing agreement . This document contains what users can and cannot do with your data, for how long and if you will get credit if the user publishes about your data.

Go to Personal Metis via https://metis.ru.nl/federation/login/personalmetis and log in with your ERNA id and password. Have a look at your results overview and check if all your publications are listed and correctly registered. Register your article in Metis within 6 months after publication (detailed instructions here) make sure to include: Title, Author(s), DOI, Email address of the corresponding EUR author, Faculty, research groups, etc. of the corresponding EUR author, Journal, Abstract (if not available in the running text), Subject headings/keywords (if not available in the running text) upload the final author version (aka postprint: the final version without the publisher\u2019s formatting) of the publication to RePub: this way, the article will become freely accessible via the green route. The library always does a final copyright check before inclusion in the database. Once registered in Metis and placed in RePub, the article receives a permanent identifier in the form of a handle, which you can use to refer to your publication when it is not gold open access. Open access: costs Publishing open access via the green route (RePub) is free of charge and highly encouraged Publishing gold open access is not always free. The VSNU has made deals with several publishers which allows researchers at Dutch universities to publish articles open access at no extra charge. However, not all publishers will point you towards this option when submitting an article or when the article is in the stage of acceptance.

In the SYNC lab, we aim to make all of our publications open access via one or more of the routes described below (green route and sometimes the golden route, preprints are published whenever deemed necessary). Why should I publish open access? Scientific work is often financed by public funds (tax payers) and therefore should be accessible to the general public Scientific results get more visible and their use is increased. This can eventually lead to a greater number of citations and thus more impact Some financers reward researchers that practice open science and sometimes require articles to be published open access (e.g., NWO, Horizon2020 and ERC) Routes to open access Publishing open access is possible via the gold and the green routes, explained below. Gold route: open access with a journal The gold route to open access means that you publish your publication in open access directly via a journal, making the contents of your publication accessible without any obstacles. Often, the author or institution pays an Article Processing Charge (APC) in order to make the article freely accessible immediately. In the Netherlands, large deals can often make sure that you don't have to pay this APC yourself! Publishing via the golden route can either go via an open access journal or in a hybrid journal. A hybrid journal still uses the traditional subscription model, but has added an open access option for which you need to pay extra. Since 2015, the NWO does not grant reimbursements anymore for publications in such hybrid journals. According to Plan S, the open access journals have to fulfill several requirements that you can find here . Green route: publishing in a repository Publishing via the green route (\"self-archiving\") entails making your publication available at a repository besides publishing it via a traditional journal. Repositories are freely accessible data storages of scientific articles and theses. Each repository should be registered in the Directory of Open Access Repositories ( OpenDOAR ). The repository of the EUR is Repub . The EUR requires that you always upload your article in Repub . Do publishers allow this? That depends on the version of your publication: - A preprint, i.e., the version that you send to the journal before peer review, is always allowed - A postprint is what you have to upload to Repub: it is the final version of your article (after peer review) without the publisher's layout and typeset - Self-archiving the version of record (publisher version) is least often allowed You can check the journal policies in Sherpa/Romeo . Preprints Publishing preprints is a form of self-archiving and can help in getting your results out there quicker. Please be aware that preprints could in theory be flawed because they are not peer reviewed. Therefore, be sure to prepare your submission well , to protect your own reputation in the scientific community. Why publish preprints? Speed : Preprints are publicly readable and do not take long to publish (besides some checks on scientific content and ethical compliance). This means your impact is immediate! Greater reach/visibility : because preprints are open access and many preprint servers are indexed by search engines (e.g., Google Scholar), the odds of reaching more people with your work increase. Some servers, such as bioRxiv, even tweet about all of their preprints. Feedback : Another reason may be to get more input on your work: it is not the final version and is therefore already subject to change, so why not take advantage of that? Prevent scooping : preprints are timestamped, so by posting it, you have established precedence! Individual benefits : such as showing your productivity to the world, showing that you are open to feedback (i.e. open attitude), staking intellectual claims to the methods, results and ideas, etc. Where to publish preprints? For example in OSF Preprints (not field specific, allows sharing supplementary files), or directly via BioRxiv, PsyArXiv or SocArXiv. You can even add a preprint on ResearchGate ! Choose whichever fits your topic and community best. A list of preprint servers hosted via OSF Preprints can be found here . Feedback and updating There are different ways researchers can give feedback on preprints: - In OSF preprints, you can use their tool Hypothes.is to annotate preprints, see their help guide - You can share contact information and send feedback to each other - Some servers offer comment functionalities (e.g., when logged in) - Use (academic) twitter What you do with feedback is completely up to you. If you want, you can update your preprint to a new version. However, note that all versions are timestamped and retained . Often new versions get a new identifier (DOI) and old versions cannot be removed! If your work gets published by a publisher, many preprint servers also offer the possibility to refer to the identifier (DOI) of your published work, so that readers of the preprint get a notification that they are not reading the most up-to-date version. Do I always have to publish a preprint? Of course not: you determine when to publish a preprint. Reasons for publishing a preprint can be: - The journal in which you want to publish has too few open access options but you still want everyone to be able to read your findings - You want your work to be part of the scientific community fast - You are looking for more feedback on your work than just the feedback provided by peer review - You want to show how open science minded you are","title":"Information"},{"location":"open-science/open-access-info.html#open-access-publishing","text":"Open access publishing means that everyone has access to your manuscripts, no matter where they are in the world and no matter if they have a journal subscription.

Recommended use of the OSF We recommend using the OSF as a central place for your project, especially if you will produce multiple publications in a project. Link your OSF project to the SYNC lab OSF page (Log in > Components > Link Projects). No worries, the SYNC lab collaborators cannot automatically edit your linked project! Register preregistrations (Registrations > New registration) and Preprints in the relevant components. If your preregistration concerns one manuscript, we recommend creating a separate component in which you link all relevant materials (publication package, preregistration, code, preprint if applicable, etc.) belonging to that manuscript. A project can contain multiple Registrations and Preprints. Be sure to provide good metadata, preferably choose a CC BY 4.0 license and create a DOI so that your preregistration is citable. Data: you can link OSF with external storage (see below) or store data on the OSF itself (choose the German storage). On the OSF itself, there is no storage limit (max.file size is currently 5 GB), but please do take privacy into account at all times Code and software: you can link OSF with a Github repository in case your preprocessing pipeline, processing steps or experimental files are stored there (see below). If your code is however not code-worthy, we recommend storing the code in the publication package or on OSF itself. Link your OSF profile to your ORCID account so that there cannot be any confusion as to who you are. Connecting the OSF to external services Via the Add-on tab, you can connect the OSF with several external services. Note that this will not store data on the OSF itself! SURF Research Drive (via Owncloud) Connecting with an Owncloud service like the Research Drive goes via a WebDAV connection. All changes made in the selected Research Drive folder will become visible in the OSF component, but the data are still stored at the EUR. Note that you can only make 1 Research Drive connection per OSF component (multiple connections per project are possible). Please note the following: Make sure the access level is read-only, unless you want your collaborators to be able to adjust the Research Drive contents Think about anonymity: if you make the project/component public, data that are shared have to be anonymous or consented by participants to share publicly Linking an Owncloud folder is not a FAIR solution: there is no curated metadata and no license. Also, the Research Drive is not meant to archive data after the project is finished, so this will always be a temporary solution. How to link a Research Drive folder to OSF Create a WebDAV password in Research Drive (Account > Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords). Copy the WebDAV password you created and click \"done\" Go to the component in your OSF project in which you want to add the Research Drive folder (if you are not in the right component, the Research Drive folder will be linked to the incorrect location) Select \u201cAdd-on\u201d to add the ownCloud Add-on in OSF Configure the add-on in OSF: URL: https://eur.data.surfsara.nl Username: erna-id@eur.nl Password: WebDAV password you just made Figshare or a publication package in the EDR You can link 1 publication package (1 Figshare link) per OSF component, so that the publication package appears in your OSF project.

Don't forget to include your collaborators and to include the link to your preregistration in your manuscript. What are Registered Reports? Registered Reports are preregistrations that are peer reviewed by journals. This highly eliminates publication bias, because at Stage 1 peer review, no results are known yet, so manuscripts cannot be accepted or rejected basead on results. Below the process of Registered Reports is visualized: After your preregistration has received an In Principle Acceptance (Stage 1), you can start collecting data and writing up your results. Most journals that get through Stage 1 will also get accepted in Stage 2, because the study design has already been reviewed.

Below the process of Registered Reports is visualized: After your preregistration has received an In Principle Acceptance (Stage 1), you can start collecting data and writing up your results.

Git is a version control system: it tracks the history as you change files. More specifically, it tracks who made which changes and when. It allows reverting files to a previous state. Note that it is possible to work on git projects locally without ever using github. Github is a git hosting platform that you can use to collaborate on projects that use git. It additionally allows for threaded discussions (issues), pull requests and several github apps. The git workflow When working on a git project (within a folder called a git repository ), you will always perform the following steps: Make changes to some file Commit the changes: make a snapshot of the changes made so far. A commit (snapshot) is always accompanied by a commit message explaining what changes were made Branches A git repository can exist in multiple \u201cversions\u201d which are called branches . There is always a \u201cmaster\u201d branch, which you should consider the clean branch. Besides that, you can create other branches that are meant to make your own changes. After you have made changes in your own branch and you think they should be incorporated in the master branch, you can then merge your branch with the master branch. Workflow on github On Github, the workflow is a bit more extensive, because often you are collaborating and do not want others to just start editing the master branch right away. There are multiple methods to collaborate on a project, but we recommend the following, assuming that there is already a repository for the project and you want to contribute: On the repository page on Github, fork the repository: this creates a copy of the repository on your own Github account that you have full access to In your repository, create a new branch for the changes you are about to make with a short but comprehensible name, e.g. \u201cdorienwritecontent\u201d You can now start editing in this branch, either on your local PC or online (in Github) Skip this step if you are editing online : If you want to edit files locally, clone your repository to your local PC, creating a folder in your file explorer (the contents of which can change according to which branch you are on!). You can use the command line or a tool such as Rstudio or GitKraken to do this. Edit the files you want to edit and commit the changes (making a snapshot; include a commit message!) Skip this step if you are editing online : You have now committed changes locally, but they are not yet visible in your \u201cremote\u201d repository, i.e., the online github repository on your account. In order to get the commits to be visible online, you need to push them to your remote. Now the changes are visible in your own account, but not in the main repository. In order to get your changes into the main repository, you need to do a pull request . This is a request to the owners of the original repository to merge your branch with theirs. Once merged by the owners, you are often prompted to remove your own branch (which is not necessary if you are planning to make more changes later). Keeping your local copy (clone) up to date If you are working on a project with many collaborators making changes, the odds are that your own fork (online copy) and/or clone (local copy) are becoming out-of-date quite fast. Therefore, it is recommended to update those copies each time before you start making changes yourself, so you are certain that you are working on the most recent versions of the files. Online (in your fork), you can do this by doing a reverse pull request: a request to yourself to merge the owner\u2019s master branch (\u201cupstream master\u201d) into your own branch that you will be working in In your clone (offline), you can set up the owner\u2019s master branch (\u201cupstream master\u201d) as the upstream master and pull changes from the upstream master (see this page for command-line instructions and this page when you use RStudio). You are simply pulling all changes made to your local PC this way. Note that your online copy is not automatically updated!

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. Every .md (Markdown) file in this repository in fact uses Markdown for formatting! For example, to indicate a second-level header, you type: ## Title of header Advantages of Markdown: It can be used for a lot of things, e.g., for creating html pages It is platform- and operating system independent You can type markdown in any text editor and open .md files with many programs, such as Atom , Zettlr , Rstudio , or even online, such as in Dillinger (in contrast to, for example, Microsoft Word), see this page for more tools that support Markdown.

There are some great features about Issues: You can assign people to the Issue who should solve it or provide input You can add the issue to a project. In the tab Projects, you can find our Kanban board in which we have made the columns \u201cTo do\u201d, \u201cIn progress\u201d and \u201cDone\u201d. We made this so we have an overview of Issues that still need work and issues that are in progress. You can add labels to an Issue (please do so!) to specify what kind of issue you are writing After the issue has been solved, you can Close it manually.
