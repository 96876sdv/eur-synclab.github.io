Also, most of us probably do not want people who aren't involved in your project to have access to our data without our knowledge. In order to deal with the sensitivity of the data and prevent them from being stolen, it is imperative that we ensure the highest possible data security. This document contains some tips to maximize data security. By following these tips, you can be more confident that your participants\u2019 privacy will be guarded and the university will not get sued :smile: Loss of data or other problems? Always report a data breach to the Servicedesk: servicedesk@eur.nl (phone +31 (0)10 408 8880), click here for more information . General data security principles Always report a (possible) data leak/breach Every loss of data is a potential data leak, such as: stolen or lost digital files: USBs, laptops, external hard drives, data that is not backed-up, etc. stolen or lost printed personal data, e.g, a note containing a password, lists with grades, etc. viruses on your PC or hacked accounts, including phishing mails both pseudonymized and anonymized data need to be reported Contact your supervisor and Servicedesk (servicedesk@eur.nl) Report the (possible) leak as soon as possible, so that we can adequately respond and limit the amount of damage for participants as much as possible. Keep in mind that measures taken are meant to secure the data, not to punish those involved! Anonymize your data The best way to guard the privacy of your participants is to anonymize your data, so that the data cannot be traced back to participants (not even with a key containing the name-number links). For longitudinal data, this can get complicated, since you want to be able to link the data of the same subject and may also need the participants\u2019 contact info for next waves. Choose safe passwords for your devices This concerns your EUR account, your laptop, your phone (if it has email on it), and all other devices that contain data. - Use a sentence instead of a word: they are harder to crack and easier to remember (especially when they are long and contain letters, numbers and signs). - Use a password manager to keep all your passwords safe, such as Lastpass . Read more about Lastpass Lastpass is a password manager that can store all your passwords safely in the cloud. You have to think of a master password - a very strong password - only once. As soon as you log in using that password, you have access to all passwords that you saved in your vault. With Lastpass you can ( all features ): Create safe passwords (no creativity required from your end) Never again have to remember passwords for all of your accounts by heart Store your passwords safely Autofill passwords on websites so that signing on will be a breeze Share passwords with others (free version: share with 1 person) Save secure notes and other details as well You can either install lastpass on your PC (or download the mobile app) or install an extension in your browser. - Get started: https://assets.cdngetgo.com/05/5c/2646701d44969ccf751043e87a42/lastpass-end-user-reference-guide.pdf - More info: https://www.lastpass.com/how-lastpass-works - User manual: https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass If possible, change your passwords or codes (e.g., to lockers) regularly Share passwords only with the people who really need it Protect mobile devices: Use a safe internet network (preferably Eduroam): never use an open network. Preferably use EduVPN , which is free for university employees and makes sure that the connection is safe. Make sure you can wipe the device and change the password(s) from a distance in case of theft or loss Make sure to have a copy of the information on the university system Always install all security updates and, if possible, antivirus and anti-malware software Do not install jailbreak/root (gaining privileged access to the operating system) Do not save confidential information, unless it is well-protected Protect files with passwords too If a file contains personal data, such as contact information, the link to a participant number or data on the MRI checklist, protect it with a password: - In Word and Excel: File > Info > Protect document/Workbook structure > Encrypt with password. You can also restrict editing via these options. - Save the password somewhere safe so that you can always access the document: if you lose the password, you cannot access the document anymore. - Only give the password to those who really need it. Try to restrict the amount of people that have access to the document. Keep paper data (logs, questionnaires, MRI checklists) locked up Do not leave data behind in labs after testing: take them with you! When testing multiple participants in one day, do not leave data from a previous participant laying around Keep papers in a locked closet or a locker and only give access to people that need it If necessary, keep a record of who has access Do not take papers with such data home or outside, unless strictly necessary Keep a clear-desk policy Do not leave any data unattended if you leave your desk for a longer period of time. - For digital data: lock your screen (Cntrl+Alt+Delete > Enter or: Windows+L) - For paper data: put them in a closed closet or locker or lock your room if no one else is present - When testing participants, do not leave data from a previous participant laying around and take them with you when you leave - This includes all desks: your own workspace, the secretariat, computer room, the lab, etc. Email safely When emailing large amounts of people (e.g., all your participants for a project newsletter), put the email addresses in the BCC (blind carbon copy) field, so that the receivers cannot see who else got the email. Put your own email address in the \u201cTo\u201d field. Where possible, use your university email, which has a safe connection with the university servers. Avoid using Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo. Never send research data via email (except when encrypted or using tools like SURF filesender). Print safely Use Secure printing to print confidential information via a password: The printer will only start printing when you have filled in a personal pin code. Securely printed documents will be erased from the university servers immediately after printing. The settings of the print job cannot be adjusted at the printer When throwing away confidential information on paper, use a container that can be locked (especially made for confidential paper). Storing your data Aim not to store data on local drives Use the Research Drive, which is automatically backed-up and secured through the university. If you are processing data on your local Data drive, be sure to back it up at the Research Drive. Don\u2019t use personal accounts to store data long-term: if you leave the university suddenly, your data will not be accessible for others! Do not store identifiable information on personal devices It is only permitted to work with sensitive data when this is necessary for data collection, processing or planning and, officially, only when participants have given their permission. If you do work with sensitive data on a personal computer (e.g., laptop), remove the data after the analyses. Do not store non-anonymized data in the cloud Never save documents online, just open them. You never know who will get their hands on your data when you store it in the cloud. - If you want to work at home, use Owncloud to interact with the Research Drive data - Or use Remote desktop: gives access to your university desktop, see this link for a manual - Or use SURFdrive , a safe alternative to Google Drive that everyone with a (Dutch) university account has access to (500 GB of personal storage) - N.B. You can request SURFdrive also for students or give students the link If using a local drive, laptop, USB, external hard drive, or video camera, the following rules apply: If you are processing data on your local drive, be sure to always back it up on the Research Drive If possible, protect the device, hard drive or drive with a password Do not put the passwords to laptops on the laptop itself When the data have been saved at the right location, delete the data from the device (shift + delete or empty the recycling bin) If you have to take devices onto the street, bring them to a (safe and appointed) university location as quickly as possible. Do not bring them home unless absolutely necessary. If you have to take data home, do let leave them unattended in a (semi)public place (such as a car or library). If possible, leave it in a locked room. Communication and sharing Do not share data via email attachments, Google Drive, etc. Instead of email attachments, use SURF filesender . Email attachments are saved on mail servers and on your PC, whereas this is not the case with filesender. If you are sending an internal email, use a hyperlink or the path to the relevant folder where possible If you want others to be able to edit the documents you share, use SURFdrive or share only the relevant files via Research Drive. Be sure the data shared are anonymous. Do not talk about or analyze individual data in public spaces For example in the elevator, a common room, public transport, social media, emails, etc. - Coding videos and audio is only allowed where other researchers from the same project work or in special coding rooms - Coding audio in a public space is only allowed when others cannot hear the audio, e.g., because you are wearing headphones - Transcribe audio and video using safe websites such as uitgetypt.nl Contacting participants outside the university When contacting participants outside the university, e.g., via your own mobile phone, make sure not to send any identifiable information via your phone (incl. sms or whatsapp) Avoid coupling participant numbers with phone numbers and/or names in emails or whatsapp messages","title":"Data security protocol"},{"location":"data-management/data-security.html#data-security-protocol","text":"We researchers deal with a lot of data: task data, questionnaire data, MRI or EEG data, but also contact information, health information, etc. Most of these data are highly sensitive, in that the risk of identification is high.

Folders A project folder (at the root of the Research Drive) has to be created by the contract administrator (currently: Dorien Huijser, later also Eveline Crone). This means that each project is created under the contract. Information needed includes (1) the name of the folder (preferably Year_ProjectName, e.g., \u201c2018_Brainlinks\u201d), (2) the data steward of the project folder and (3) the amount of storage needed (can still be changed later) Storage : our contract, \u201cESSB Brain and Development\u201d, currently has 16 TB of storage capacity which is divided among the existing project folders. More storage capacity has to be requested with Research Data Management/Jeroen Rombouts (who in turn requests this at SURF) by the contract administrator. 2. Requesting and giving access Requesting access (users) Request access to a folder with the data steward of the relevant project. You can find who is the data steward for which project in the file \u201c ResearchDrive_overview_Projects_Access_Groups \u201d . Giving access (data stewards) Select the folder and click the sharing icon. In the area that appears, you can add individual users or groups and alternatively, create sharing links (URLs) with non-Research Drive users. Giving access to a folder means providing that selected access for all subfolders below the shared folder too. Give only the necessary access: preferably never give anyone sharing rights (unless strictly necessary), because that person can give others more rights than they themselves have. This causes you to lose overview of who can access the data. Giving access to Research Drive users Custom groups Give Research Drive users access via personal access groups (Settings > Custom groups). Members in such a group all receive the same rights when added to a folder. The owner of the group is the only one who can add and remove access group members and see the members of the group. However, all access group names are visible for the entire Research Drive, so please aptly name the groups according to the following format: SYNC_ProjectName_Accesslevel , e.g., \"SYNC_Brainlinks_edit\". If a new person needs access, they can be added to the relevant access group and automatically gains access to the same files/folders as the other group members. After you have made any changes in access groups, please update \u201c ResearchDrive_overview_Projects_Access_Groups \u201d (in SYNC_General/ Research_Drive) so we can keep an overview of who has access to what and who owns which access group. Individual users Add users to folders individually if they should not have the same permissions as the custom groups. This could for example be outside researchers. Please note that users of SURFdrive do not necessarily need a new Research Drive account, you can simply share the relevant files/folders with their Federated cloud ID . #### Students and other outside users Generally, when sharing data with students or outsiders, stick to the following guidelines: Share data only when the sharing serves a scientific goal Keep the amount of data shared to a minimum (only the data necessary to reach the scientific goal) Pseudonymize or, if possible, anonymize data before sharing (e.g., by removing direct and indirect identifiers) Students should additionally sign a non-disclosure agreement and stick to the working guidelines for students Give students and outside users access via access links that allow Download/View/Upload (edit only if it concerns a separate (Students) folder). Please make use of the password and end-date functions: students and outside users should not have access to the data after their internships / the agreement have/has ended and the password will give extra protection against non-authorized use. Alternatively, you could add the external users or students as new Research Drive users (Dashboard > Add user), although for large amounts of users, this is not recommended. 3. Uploading data to Research Drive Rclone Rclone is a command-line tool to upload data to any location. It can run easily in the background and is relatively simple. Download rclone: https://rclone.org/downloads/ (no admin rights needed) Once downloaded, open your Command prompt (search for cmd) Your command prompt shows a drive which it uses, e.g., P:/. Move the unwrapped rclone files (at least rclone.exe) to that drive. In your command prompt, type rclone config In your Research Drive account, create a WebDAV password: Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords. Create a new password by filling in the name, e.g., \u201cRclone\u201d. Copy the password that was just created to a temporary file/your clipboard. Follow the instructions listed here . Use the following link (step 3): https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/remote.php/nonshib-webdav/ , username: ERNAid@eur.nl; password: Webdav password you just created (you will probably not see the password being pasted, but it is!). When you are asked for a \"bearer token\", just press Enter Example summary of the config: [RD] type = webdav url = https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/remote.php/nonshib-webdav/ vendor = owncloud user = 75800lvc@eur.nl pass = gqxEPZP1TQWhsOT4pEMkEhJGcOXYiG-mV-gR_UMM Uploading data using Rclone General format: rclone copy [flags] \u2018source\u2019 RD:\u2018destination\u2019 Example command (run from your command window): rclone copy -v -P --ignore-existing \u201cJ:\\ResearchData\\FSW\\Brain and Development - Projects\\2018_Brainlinks\\Ouderstudie\\\u201d RD:\u201c2018_Brainlinks (Projectfolder)/Brainlinks_Parentstudy\u201d , meaning: Copy folder 1 contents (source) to folder 2 (destination), print progress (-v and -P) and skip already existing files Other Rclone commands List the files in the specified folder: rclone ls RD:\u201c2016_Zelfbeeld (Projectfolder)/Zelfbeeld_Data/Zelfbeeld_ProcessedData/\u201d Show configuration details: rclone config show Edit the configuration details: rclone config e More information on Rclone Wiki: https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/RDRIVE/4.+Access+Research+Drive+via+Rclone Flags to add to commands: https://rclone.org/flags/ TROEP NOG DOEN Cyberduck - setting up Cyberduck is not a command-line tool but has a GUI (graphical user interface) for uploading data. It also has built-in encryption software (cryptomator), which allows simultaneously encrypting and uploading data. Download and install Cyberduck (the program is free so select 0$ of donation) - you do need admin access for this tool. Read the wiki page of SURF Research Drive and from there download the Research Drive cyberduck profile . Save the Research Drive cyberduck profile in the \u201cProfiles\u201d folder within your Cyberduck program files folder (e.g., \u201cC:\\Program Files\\Cyberduck\\profiles\u201d) In your Research Drive account, create a WebDAV password: go to Settings (Instellingen) at the top right of the homescreen select the Security (Beveiliging) tab and scroll down to \u201cWebDAV passwords\u201d create a new password by filling in the name, e.g., \u201cCyberduck\u201d copy the password that was just created to a temporary file/your clipboard (Re)Start Cyberduck Click \u201cNew connection\u201d (Nieuwe verbinding). In the pop-up window that appears select the SURF Research Drive profile change the server to eur.data.surfsara.nl fill out your username (ERNA ID) and the WebDAV password that you just created in Research Drive. Do not forget to select \u201c Save password \u201d (Bewaar wachtwoord)! Select \u201cConnect\u201d (Verbind). After having made the connection, you should see your (project) folders like in Research Drive. Every time Cyberduck restarts, this connection will be made, except when you explicitly disconnect (then you have to re-connect again). Uploading data in Cyberduck Turn on Checksum (Edit > Preferences > Wachtrij (Queue) > Checksum) Select a folder in which you want to upload files Click Upload and select the files to be uploaded. Once your files have been uploaded, they should appear in your Research Drive! 4. Uploading sensitive data to Research Drive What to encrypt? Research Drive cannot contain special types of personal data (bijzondere persoonsgegevens). These comprise of: Race, ethnicity, political views, religion Sexual life/preferences Genetic or biometric data with the purpose of unique identification Health information, among which medical data (MRI data!) Criminal past Most of this information is collected via questionnaires and during the call to select participants (e.g., MRI checklist). Raw MRI data containing faces should also be considered special personal data. The following data need to be encrypted before uploading to Research Drive: Participant databases with contact information* MRI checklist information files (\u201cBijzonderhedenbestand\u201d) containing information about past surgeries and other health information* Files containing demographic data, responses about race, political views, religion, sexual life, criminal past and other potential health information** Raw, non-defaced MRI images (esp. anatomical images) *Besides encryption, you can also store these files at EUR locally, but files 1-3 still need to be protected with a password. This type of file can be stored on Research Drive without encryption only in case that the data are pseudonymized / not directly traceable to individuals. How to encrypt? 1) Passwords Putting a password on an Excel or Word file is also a safe form of encryption. Be sure to keep the password at a safe location: If you lose the password, the data is not accessible anymore. 2) Within Cyberduck Cyberduck has in-built functionality to encrypt files using Cryptomator . To encrypt files, you first need to create an encrypted folder. In Cyberduck (after having been connected to your Research Drive), select the folder in which you want to create the encrypted folder Right click and select \u201cNew locked vault\u201d (Nieuwe versleutelde safe) Give the vault a name (remember to put the Project name in there, e.g., \u201cBrainlinks_Neural_data_raw\u201d) and a password (passphrase). Store the password in your password manager or somewhere else safe immediately. If you lose this password, the data cannot be accessed anymore! Cyberduck will also save the password, but if others besides you need to be able to access the folder as well, they need the password too to decrypt the files. You can now upload folders into this encrypted folder as with normal folders. In the background, Cyberduck will decrypt your own encrypted folders for you automatically (because it knows the password), which is why it looks no different than a normal folder in your own Cyberduck environment. However, if you look in your Research Drive, you will see nonsense files and/or folders. Also, if others create an encrypted folder, Cyberduck will ask you for the password to decrypt because it does not know it yet. 3) Using Cryptomator You do not necessarily need Cyberduck in order to encrypt folders. For example, when you use Rclone to upload data, you may still need to encrypt some of the data before uploading. In order to do this, you do need to install the newest version of Cryptomator separately: Download and install Cryptomator: https://cryptomator.org/downloads/ Creating an encrypted folder: https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/desktop/getting-started/ Opening (decrypting) an encrypted folder: https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/desktop/accessing-vaults/. When decrypted, the folder will appear in a separate path (drive), which you can give to tools such as Matlab and R to work with them. After usage, remember to lock the vault again! Note : Cryptomator asks for a password, but also allows saving a recovery key for when the password gets lost. Please also save this key, so that the data can never be lost! When to encrypt? Old projects: save both the source MRI data (non-defaced) and the raw defaced data. Encrypt the non-defaced data. New projects: immediately deface the MRI data so that encryption is not needed Saving passwords When encrypting files or folders, we recommend storing the passwords in a safe place: Lastpass stores your passwords in a vault the cloud (behind 1 main, strong password). It can also store secure notes (such as Cryptomator recovery keys) and allows sharing passwords with others (although the free version only allows sharing with 1 other account). As an extention in your web browser, it also autofills the saved passwords. Storing files locally is also an option, but keep in mind that: When your PC is hacked, hackers may have access to the passwords When your PC / drive crashes, the passwords may be lost Storing on a network drive : make sure that that drive is secured, backed up and only accessible to those who are allowed to decrypt the data Sharing passwords When sharing encryption passwords, do it safely! Via Lastpass : Network center > Share item. If you have the free version and you want to share the password with more than 1 person, this is not the best option. Via SURFfilesender: per password and recovery key, create a txt file. Send it/them via SURF filesender , make sure a password is required to download the file(s). Send the password to the receiver(s) via another way (e.g., text or slack message). 5. Working with data (editing and analysis) Editing documents The easiest way to edit documents is in your browser. The main advantage of this is that the browser (OnlyOffice) allows collaborative editing and changes are automatically saved. If you mount Research Drive to your file explorer and then edit the document at the same time someone else does, there will be merging conflicts and the version with the last edit \u201cwins\u201d. Mounting Research Drive to your file explorer You can mount your Research Drive account to your file explorer, so that the Research Drive files can be accessed on your local PC. Note that collaborative editing is not possible this way, and merging conflicts may emerge when multiple people are working on the same files. Tools: \\1. OwnCloud : This is the tool recommended by SURF which is handy for working with small and few files. However, it is not suitable for synchronizing large (numbers of) files . Go to this link OR in Research Drive, go to your name in the right upper corner and select Settings (Instellingen). Scroll all the way down until you see something like this: ... Download the OwnCloud client suitable for your operating system See the Research Drive wiki page for how to configure OwnCloud further. Use the link eur.data.surfsara.nl to connect with and authorize the share by logging in to your Research Drive account. Choose Selective synchronization and select only the folders you need to work on from your local machine. All synced files are stored and synced on your local machine. If your Research Drive storage is really high, you should not sync them all with your PC. Alternatively, choose Virtual file support , which makes sure that only documents that are being worked on are downloaded. Note : ownCloud does not show encrypted files and folders and so does not allow to work with them. \\2. Access as a network drive via WebDAV . The main advantage of this way is that no files are actually synced or stored at your harddisk. The disadvantage is that you only have access to the files with an internet connection (accessing files can be slow) and the native Windows and Mac OS implementations are not great. See this link for how to configure this The password you need is a WebDAV password again: Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords > Create new password, e.g. \u201c20200417_WebDAV\u201d > Copy the password. Note: WebDAV does show encrypted files and folders, but does not decrypt them. Analyzing data - options There are multiple ways that you can analyze data: Locally: download the data to your local PC and analyze them there. Advantages: no dependencies on your internet connection Disadvantages: not great for large (numbers of) files, no cloud synchronization, data are stored at your local PC, so there will be multiple copies of the data Use a mounting tool (see above) and run analyses on data that are stored in Research Drive as if the data were stored at your local PC Advantages: cloud synchronization, no download necessary Disadvantages: Not great for large (numbers of) files In owncloud, data that is used will (at least temporarily) be stored at your local harddisk (except when using virtual file support). This can cause your PC to become very slow. Via WebDAV, the speed of processing depends on your internet connection (you will work via a network drive) Synchronization will take a while if you create/edit large numbers of files. Make sure to only synchronize files that you really need if you want to analyze data this way. Use a cloud computing service, e.g., Jupyter Hub (also built into Research Drive) and the SURF LISA cluster Advantages: no local copies need to be made, fast data analysis since the cluster has large computing capacity Disadvantages: mostly meant for MRI data analysis, can be expensive if used a lot Working with MRI data: recommended methods Defaced data synchronized with PC Deface before uploading data to RD. First deface, then turn into .hrd and .img files Upload data to RD and synchronize ONLY the folder(s) that you need on your PC via OwnCloud (your PC needs to have enough memory to save the data, also after preprocessing/analysis). You can then enter the path to the OwnCloud folder that was synchronized to your PC in SPM when you do batch preprocessing or first level analysis. Defaced data not synchronized with PC When data is not synchronized, you cannot give SPM a valid path name. This is therefore not possible. Encrypted data synchronized with PC Encrypted folders are useless (they contain random files with weird names) if you do not have the key. Encrypting: Upload the data to RD, encrypt a folder as highest as possible in the hierarchy (e.g., Neural data) so that you only have to decrypt one folder to do analyses on that data. Synchronize ONLY the folder(s) that you need on your PC. Use Cryptomator to decrypt the folder (enter the password) and click Reveal The main folder (e.g., Neural data) is shown as a separate directory on your PC. You can add this directory to your Matlab/SPM path.

Once your files have been uploaded, they should appear in your Research Drive!","title":"TROEP"},{"location":"data-management/research-drive-how.html#4-uploading-sensitive-data-to-research-drive","text":"What to encrypt? Research Drive cannot contain special types of personal data (bijzondere persoonsgegevens). These comprise of: Race, ethnicity, political views, religion Sexual life/preferences Genetic or biometric data with the purpose of unique identification Health information, among which medical data (MRI data!) Criminal past Most of this information is collected via questionnaires and during the call to select participants (e.g., MRI checklist). Raw MRI data containing faces should also be considered special personal data. The following data need to be encrypted before uploading to Research Drive: Participant databases with contact information* MRI checklist information files (\u201cBijzonderhedenbestand\u201d) containing information about past surgeries and other health information* Files containing demographic data, responses about race, political views, religion, sexual life, criminal past and other potential health information** Raw, non-defaced MRI images (esp. anatomical images) *Besides encryption, you can also store these files at EUR locally, but files 1-3 still need to be protected with a password. This type of file can be stored on Research Drive without encryption only in case that the data are pseudonymized / not directly traceable to individuals. How to encrypt? 1) Passwords Putting a password on an Excel or Word file is also a safe form of encryption. Be sure to keep the password at a safe location: If you lose the password, the data is not accessible anymore. 2) Within Cyberduck Cyberduck has in-built functionality to encrypt files using Cryptomator . To encrypt files, you first need to create an encrypted folder. In Cyberduck (after having been connected to your Research Drive), select the folder in which you want to create the encrypted folder Right click and select \u201cNew locked vault\u201d (Nieuwe versleutelde safe) Give the vault a name (remember to put the Project name in there, e.g., \u201cBrainlinks_Neural_data_raw\u201d) and a password (passphrase). Store the password in your password manager or somewhere else safe immediately. If you lose this password, the data cannot be accessed anymore! Cyberduck will also save the password, but if others besides you need to be able to access the folder as well, they need the password too to decrypt the files. You can now upload folders into this encrypted folder as with normal folders. In the background, Cyberduck will decrypt your own encrypted folders for you automatically (because it knows the password), which is why it looks no different than a normal folder in your own Cyberduck environment. However, if you look in your Research Drive, you will see nonsense files and/or folders. Also, if others create an encrypted folder, Cyberduck will ask you for the password to decrypt because it does not know it yet. 3) Using Cryptomator You do not necessarily need Cyberduck in order to encrypt folders. For example, when you use Rclone to upload data, you may still need to encrypt some of the data before uploading. In order to do this, you do need to install the newest version of Cryptomator separately: Download and install Cryptomator: https://cryptomator.org/downloads/ Creating an encrypted folder: https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/desktop/getting-started/ Opening (decrypting) an encrypted folder: https://docs.cryptomator.org/en/latest/desktop/accessing-vaults/. When decrypted, the folder will appear in a separate path (drive), which you can give to tools such as Matlab and R to work with them. After usage, remember to lock the vault again! Note : Cryptomator asks for a password, but also allows saving a recovery key for when the password gets lost. Please also save this key, so that the data can never be lost! When to encrypt? Old projects: save both the source MRI data (non-defaced) and the raw defaced data. Encrypt the non-defaced data. New projects: immediately deface the MRI data so that encryption is not needed Saving passwords When encrypting files or folders, we recommend storing the passwords in a safe place: Lastpass stores your passwords in a vault the cloud (behind 1 main, strong password). It can also store secure notes (such as Cryptomator recovery keys) and allows sharing passwords with others (although the free version only allows sharing with 1 other account). As an extention in your web browser, it also autofills the saved passwords. Storing files locally is also an option, but keep in mind that: When your PC is hacked, hackers may have access to the passwords When your PC / drive crashes, the passwords may be lost Storing on a network drive : make sure that that drive is secured, backed up and only accessible to those who are allowed to decrypt the data Sharing passwords When sharing encryption passwords, do it safely! Via Lastpass : Network center > Share item. If you have the free version and you want to share the password with more than 1 person, this is not the best option. Via SURFfilesender: per password and recovery key, create a txt file. Send it/them via SURF filesender , make sure a password is required to download the file(s). Send the password to the receiver(s) via another way (e.g., text or slack message).","title":"4. Uploading sensitive data to Research Drive"},{"location":"data-management/research-drive-how.html#5-working-with-data-editing-and-analysis","text":"Editing documents The easiest way to edit documents is in your browser. The main advantage of this is that the browser (OnlyOffice) allows collaborative editing and changes are automatically saved. If you mount Research Drive to your file explorer and then edit the document at the same time someone else does, there will be merging conflicts and the version with the last edit \u201cwins\u201d. Mounting Research Drive to your file explorer You can mount your Research Drive account to your file explorer, so that the Research Drive files can be accessed on your local PC. Note that collaborative editing is not possible this way, and merging conflicts may emerge when multiple people are working on the same files. Tools: \\1. OwnCloud : This is the tool recommended by SURF which is handy for working with small and few files. However, it is not suitable for synchronizing large (numbers of) files . Go to this link OR in Research Drive, go to your name in the right upper corner and select Settings (Instellingen). Scroll all the way down until you see something like this: ... Download the OwnCloud client suitable for your operating system See the Research Drive wiki page for how to configure OwnCloud further. Use the link eur.data.surfsara.nl to connect with and authorize the share by logging in to your Research Drive account. Choose Selective synchronization and select only the folders you need to work on from your local machine. All synced files are stored and synced on your local machine. If your Research Drive storage is really high, you should not sync them all with your PC. Alternatively, choose Virtual file support , which makes sure that only documents that are being worked on are downloaded. Note : ownCloud does not show encrypted files and folders and so does not allow to work with them. \\2. Access as a network drive via WebDAV . The main advantage of this way is that no files are actually synced or stored at your harddisk. The disadvantage is that you only have access to the files with an internet connection (accessing files can be slow) and the native Windows and Mac OS implementations are not great. See this link for how to configure this The password you need is a WebDAV password again: Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords > Create new password, e.g. \u201c20200417_WebDAV\u201d > Copy the password. Note: WebDAV does show encrypted files and folders, but does not decrypt them. Analyzing data - options There are multiple ways that you can analyze data: Locally: download the data to your local PC and analyze them there. Advantages: no dependencies on your internet connection Disadvantages: not great for large (numbers of) files, no cloud synchronization, data are stored at your local PC, so there will be multiple copies of the data Use a mounting tool (see above) and run analyses on data that are stored in Research Drive as if the data were stored at your local PC Advantages: cloud synchronization, no download necessary Disadvantages: Not great for large (numbers of) files In owncloud, data that is used will (at least temporarily) be stored at your local harddisk (except when using virtual file support). This can cause your PC to become very slow. Via WebDAV, the speed of processing depends on your internet connection (you will work via a network drive) Synchronization will take a while if you create/edit large numbers of files. Make sure to only synchronize files that you really need if you want to analyze data this way. Use a cloud computing service, e.g., Jupyter Hub (also built into Research Drive) and the SURF LISA cluster Advantages: no local copies need to be made, fast data analysis since the cluster has large computing capacity Disadvantages: mostly meant for MRI data analysis, can be expensive if used a lot Working with MRI data: recommended methods Defaced data synchronized with PC Deface before uploading data to RD. First deface, then turn into .hrd and .img files Upload data to RD and synchronize ONLY the folder(s) that you need on your PC via OwnCloud (your PC needs to have enough memory to save the data, also after preprocessing/analysis). You can then enter the path to the OwnCloud folder that was synchronized to your PC in SPM when you do batch preprocessing or first level analysis. Defaced data not synchronized with PC When data is not synchronized, you cannot give SPM a valid path name. This is therefore not possible. Encrypted data synchronized with PC Encrypted folders are useless (they contain random files with weird names) if you do not have the key. Encrypting: Upload the data to RD, encrypt a folder as highest as possible in the hierarchy (e.g., Neural data) so that you only have to decrypt one folder to do analyses on that data. Synchronize ONLY the folder(s) that you need on your PC. Use Cryptomator to decrypt the folder (enter the password) and click Reveal The main folder (e.g., Neural data) is shown as a separate directory on your PC. You can add this directory to your Matlab/SPM path.

Research Drive is a cloud environment offered by SURF and used by Erasmus University Rotterdam to store research data during the active research phase. It is not meant for long-term archiving, data publishing or data analysis! In a way, Research Drive is similar to Google Drive, in that files are stored in the cloud , can be shared and collaboratively edited. The difference is that data are stored safely in the Netherlands (backed-up weekly) \u00e1nd that there is no personal storage , only team storage (storage per project) - in contrast to SURFdrive (500GB personal storage). This means that everyone who has access to a project folder can upload data up to the maximum storage assigned to that project. Data will therefore always be part of the project and remain accessible to the project members, even when end-users leave of permissions are changed. There are also several integrations with other applications and environment (LISA cluster, Jupyter Hub, HPC cloud, OwnCloud, OnlyOffice which allows collaborative editing in the internet browser, etc.). Roles and permissions In Research Drive, each project gets a storage quotum and a data steward. The data steward gives rights to end-users. If permitted, end-users can upload data in the folders they received rights to. Roles within Research Drive: Site administrator : manager of the entire (EUR-)instance > usually someone from SURF Dashboard administrator : manages all contracts, can add new contracts and assigns contract administrators > someone from EUR Contract administrator/owner (currently Dorien for the SYNC lab): manages a contract that has a specific amount of storage available to divide over the projects under the contract: can create project folders including a storage quotuum and data steward for each project does not automatically have access to the created projects Data steward : responsible for specific project(s): gives rights to members or groups by permissions on folder level can invite new members can always see all project contents Member : normal end-user, anyone can add new members by sending invitations (but data stewards have to give them permissions) Sharing files and folders Data stewards can give the following permissions to users: Read-only : keep in mind that copying data to a local machine is always possible Write : Create: create and add new items and rename existing folders Change: upload and replace existing items in the folder Delete: delete existingg items in the folder Share : can re-share the item or a child item. If users have this right, they can set (perhaps broader) permissions for other users. This is not recommended, since you can quickly lose overview of who has access to which data.

All users in that group then have the same permissions. Others cannot see who is in the group, but Anyone can find the group name, so make a well-defined, distinguishing group name, e.g., \"SYNC_Brainlinks_edit\" A SURFdrive user : if someone can use SURFdrive via their institution, they don't need a new Research Drive account.

Sharing data is becoming the golden standard in science. It enables others to reproduce your results and prevent fraud and honest mistakes in data analysis. Moreover, it enables reuse of your data in new analyses, increasing the impact of your work. Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways: 1. Publish in a data repository For example: - The EUR Data Repository : for publication packages at the EUR - All data and materials accompanying a publication - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets or non-anonymous data - See the publication packages page for more information. - DANS DataverseNL : for publication packages at Leiden University - All data and materials accompanying a publication - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets (max zip file size 10 GB) or non-anonymous data - DANS EASY (Dutch) - For data and materials, not necessarily accompanying a publication - Has deals with the university but still some limitations to the size of the data (max. 100 GB) - Is aimed more at archiving than sharing data - NeuroVault - For group-MRI data (such as t-maps) accompanying a publication - Enables meta-analysis of fMRI-studies - See the NeuroVault page for more information - Open Science Framework - max. 5 GB per file - Keep your data close to all other relevant files in your OSF project - OSF is more aimed at project management than dissemination, read more here - Other general-purpose repositories, such as Zenodo (free up to 50GB), Dryad (not free) or Non-EUR Figshare (free, max 20GB private space and 5GB per file) In all cases, make your data FAIR , see the data management page and take privacy considerations into account. 2. Publish a datapaper You can also publish a dataset in a data journal without the need to add it to a publication. In a datapaper, you describe the data and the methods of collecting them, without the need to analyze them. This will get you a publication out of your data irrespective of whether or not you publish results. This however often (but not always) requires that you make all described data public, because the aim of such publications is to provide access to high quality datasets and to facilitate reuse. Also, most journals have some policy in which repository you should deposit the data accompanying the datapaper. Note that a datapaper will be peer-reviewed just as well as a regular article. See this link for a list of data journals. 3. Via supplementary materials in a published paper This is better than nothing, but not recommended, because this does not adhere to the FAIR principles . Also, there is often a limit to the size or number of supplementary files that a journal can host, limiting the possibilities to publish data. 4. Share case-by-case For data that cannot be shared publicly, you can sometimes still share the data case-by-case. This can be the case: For MRI-data for which you have informed consent from the participants to share. You may not want to publish this publicly because of the sensitive nature of the data, but you can still share the data because you have consent. Of course this also goes for other kinds of sensitive data for which you have consent. For data that does not belong to a publication, data that is too large to share in another way or some other reason Copyright & licences Copyright includes the rights that you automatically get when you create something, such as an article or dataset (although there are differing opinions on whether or not data is the result of a creative endeavor). The copyright on a work will always be yours, except when you explicitly (partially) give it to someone else, such as a publisher. With licenses , such as Creative Commons licenses , you specify what others are permitted to do with your product. You can see it as some kind of agreement: if someone violates the license, you have the right to sue them, just like a regular lawful agreement. For data, it is recommended to choose a CC0 (public domain) or CC-BY 4.0 license. These open licences both allow others to use the data without many restrictions.

A data sharing agreement can be set up between the owner of research data and someone with whom data is shared or who will process the data further. Important components of such an agreement are that the receiver of the data will not try to identify the participants and will not share the data with third parties. This leaves a high degree of control for the data owner concerning who has access to the data. When to use a data sharing agreement? The data cannot be made entirely anonymous (i.e., you have pseudonymized data), AND The participant has given explicit informed consent to share their data with other researchers When data can be made entirely anonymous, you do not strictly need a data sharing agreement (although not forbidden of course). When the participant has NOT given explicit informed consent to share their personal data (non-anonymous data), you are legally NOT ALLOWED to share their personal data at all. In the latter case, try to find a way to anonymize the data or do not share the data at all. Who needs to sign the data sharing agreement? Someone with permission to make lawful decisions under the flag of the university has to sign the agreemement. This should in principle be the Scientific Director (\"WD\", Wetenschappelijk Directeur), from BOTH institutes involved. However, the Scientific Director can give permission (\"volmacht\") to others to make those decisions for him/her (e.g., via an email stating this and for how long the permission is given).

Whether you can share your research data with others depends on: 1. The anonymity of your data 2. Who owns your data 3. The infrastructure available to share the data In this chapter, we will go into nr. 1 and talk about the EU privacy law: the General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR Since May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming [AVG]) has been in place to better protect personal data. The most important aspects of the GDPR are: Privacy by Design : build privacy-increasing measures into your study design Privacy by Default : make sure your default settings already improve your participants' privacy Data minimization : Only collect and use personal data necessary for your research goal Legal basis : Make sure there is a legal basis (6 possible) to process (and share) the personal data you collect (e.g., informed consent or public interest more info (Dutch) DPIA : Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment whenever you collect (highly) sensitive data, such as names, addresses, race or health data. Inform participants about the goal of the personal data collection and which data you collect. What is personal data? Data is personal when you can identify someone by it, either directly (e.g., name, address) or indirectly (e.g., height, job, income, education). Indirect indicators are personal data if they can identify someone: when it concerns an extreme case (e.g., someone 2.20m tall) when combining data so that they can only be applicable to one person (NB. this can also concern publicly available data) when re-identification is still possible (e.g., with a name-number key conversion file) By law, data is considered identifiable when identification can occur with reasonable (proportionate) effort. Thus, it is not about the hypothetical possibility that data can be linked or combined. Because not everyone has access to the same data, the definition of \"identifiable\" may differ per situation. Important types of data Pseudonymous data : Data that is only identifiable with a key (that still exists). This is the case when after encryption, it is still possible to identify someone, e.g., because the key or the source data still exist. Pseudonymous data are still considered personal data , because the encryption is reversible , thus requiring a legal basis for processing. Special personal data : special sensitive categories of personal data that may be difficult to anonymize, they require additional measures: race or ethnic descent political views religion union membership genetic or biometric data aimed at unique identification health data sexual life and preference criminal records in the Netherlands: Burgerservicenummer (BSN) Anonymous data : Data that are not (re)identifiable anymore: neiher by a name-number key, nor by combining with other publicly available data. Anonymous data are not considered personal data , so processing and sharing this kind of data do not require a legal basis. Sharing data under the GDPR Anonymous data can be shared without restriction if they are really anonymous. You may share non-anonymous data only when: You have attained explicit informed consent from the participant to do so (most used legal basis). For special personal data, this consent should be very explicit (\"I agree to share x, y and z\" with A, B and C): there cannot be any doubt about this.

Anonymizing data General tips Remove identifiers (name, address) Replace identifiers (e.g., date of birth by age or age groups) Use pseudonyms (e.g., participant numbers) Randomize the pseudonyms (participant numbers) Use only the middle range of the data: extreme cases may lead to identification because by definition, there are only few of them Remove the name-participant number key Plan how to anonymize the data up front and keep a log of your procedures Store original data in a safe location Determine whether different measures combined could lead to identification. If needed, consult a privacy officer. Deidentifying MRI-data There is some debate as to whether or not MRI data can be anonymized. One paper, for example, found that brain morphology, although preprocessed, was personally identifiable ( Takao, Hayashi, & Ohtomo, 2015 ). Moreover, it could be argued that, when combining multiple databases, the data may be identifiable in that way as well. Therefore, we do not speak of anonymizing MRI-data, but deidentifying it: MRI-data will always remain pseudonymous at best and therefore require a legal basis before sharing. Anonymize the filenames: replace names with codes Remove the header information (when using hdr and img files, not for nifti files) Deface the MRI-scans if your software does not do that automatically already. We recommend using pydeface , which is implemented in bidsify If you are uncertain whether your data are anonymous, please don't hesitate to contact a privacy officer.

In the SYNC lab, we aim to make all of our publications open access via one or more of the routes described below (green route and sometimes the golden route, preprints are published whenever deemed necessary). Why should I publish open access? Scientific work is often financed by public funds (tax payers) and therefore should be accessible to the general public Scientific results get more visible and their use is increased. This can eventually lead to a greater number of citations and thus more impact Some financers reward researchers that practice open science and sometimes require articles to be published open access (e.g., NWO, Horizon2020 and ERC) Routes to open access Publishing open access is possible via the gold and the green routes, explained below. Gold route: open access with a journal The gold route to open access means that you publish your publication in open access directly via a journal, making the contents of your publication accessible without any obstacles. Often, the author or institution pays an Article Processing Charge (APC) in order to make the article freely accessible immediately. In the Netherlands, large deals can often make sure that you don't have to pay this APC yourself! Publishing via the golden route can either go via an open access journal or in a hybrid journal. A hybrid journal still uses the traditional subscription model, but has added an open access option for which you need to pay extra. Since 2015, the NWO does not grant reimbursements anymore for publications in such hybrid journals. According to Plan S, the open access journals have to fulfill several requirements that you can find here . Green route: publishing in a repository Publishing via the green route (\"self-archiving\") entails making your publication available at a repository besides publishing it via a traditional journal. Repositories are freely accessible data storages of scientific articles and theses. Each repository should be registered in the Directory of Open Access Repositories ( OpenDOAR ). The repository of the EUR is Repub . The EUR requires that you always upload your article in Repub . Do publishers allow this? That depends on the version of your publication: - A preprint, i.e., the version that you send to the journal before peer review, is always allowed - A postprint is what you have to upload to Repub: it is the final version of your article (after peer review) without the publisher's layout and typeset - Self-archiving the version of record (publisher version) is least often allowed You can check the journal policies in Sherpa/Romeo . Preprints Publishing preprints is a form of self-archiving and can help in getting your results out there quicker. Please be aware that preprints could in theory be flawed because they are not peer reviewed. Therefore, be sure to prepare your submission well , to protect your own reputation in the scientific community. Why publish preprints? Speed : Preprints are publicly readable and do not take long to publish (besides some checks on scientific content and ethical compliance). This means your impact is immediate! Greater reach/visibility : because preprints are open access and many preprint servers are indexed by search engines (e.g., Google Scholar), the odds of reaching more people with your work increase. Some servers, such as bioRxiv, even tweet about all of their preprints. Feedback : Another reason may be to get more input on your work: it is not the final version and is therefore already subject to change, so why not take advantage of that? Prevent scooping : preprints are timestamped, so by posting it, you have established precedence! Individual benefits : such as showing your productivity to the world, showing that you are open to feedback (i.e. open attitude), staking intellectual claims to the methods, results and ideas, etc. Where to publish preprints? For example in OSF Preprints (not field specific, allows sharing supplementary files), or directly via BioRxiv, PsyArXiv or SocArXiv. You can even add a preprint on ResearchGate ! Choose whichever fits your topic and community best. A list of preprint servers hosted via OSF Preprints can be found here . Feedback and updating There are different ways researchers can give feedback on preprints: - In OSF preprints, you can use their tool Hypothes.is to annotate preprints, see their help guide - You can share contact information and send feedback to each other - Some servers offer comment functionalities (e.g., when logged in) - Use (academic) twitter What you do with feedback is completely up to you. If you want, you can update your preprint to a new version. However, note that all versions are timestamped and retained . Often new versions get a new identifier (DOI) and old versions cannot be removed! If your work gets published by a publisher, many preprint servers also offer the possibility to refer to the identifier (DOI) of your published work, so that readers of the preprint get a notification that they are not reading the most up-to-date version. Do I always have to publish a preprint? Of course not: you determine when to publish a preprint. Reasons for publishing a preprint can be: - The journal in which you want to publish has too few open access options but you still want everyone to be able to read your findings - You want your work to be part of the scientific community fast - You are looking for more feedback on your work than just the feedback provided by peer review - You want to show how open science minded you are","title":"Information"},{"location":"open-science/open-access-info.html#open-access-publishing","text":"Open access publishing means that everyone has access to your manuscripts, no matter where they are in the world and no matter if they have a journal subscription.

That depends on the version of your publication: - A preprint, i.e., the version that you send to the journal before peer review, is always allowed - A postprint is what you have to upload to Repub: it is the final version of your article (after peer review) without the publisher's layout and typeset - Self-archiving the version of record (publisher version) is least often allowed You can check the journal policies in Sherpa/Romeo .","title":"Green route: publishing in a repository"},{"location":"open-science/open-access-info.html#preprints","text":"Publishing preprints is a form of self-archiving and can help in getting your results out there quicker.

This means your impact is immediate! Greater reach/visibility : because preprints are open access and many preprint servers are indexed by search engines (e.g., Google Scholar), the odds of reaching more people with your work increase. Some servers, such as bioRxiv, even tweet about all of their preprints. Feedback : Another reason may be to get more input on your work: it is not the final version and is therefore already subject to change, so why not take advantage of that? Prevent scooping : preprints are timestamped, so by posting it, you have established precedence! Individual benefits : such as showing your productivity to the world, showing that you are open to feedback (i.e. open attitude), staking intellectual claims to the methods, results and ideas, etc.","title":"Why publish preprints?"},{"location":"open-science/open-access-info.html#where-to-publish-preprints","text":"For example in OSF Preprints (not field specific, allows sharing supplementary files), or directly via BioRxiv, PsyArXiv or SocArXiv.

If you want, you can update your preprint to a new version. However, note that all versions are timestamped and retained . Often new versions get a new identifier (DOI) and old versions cannot be removed! If your work gets published by a publisher, many preprint servers also offer the possibility to refer to the identifier (DOI) of your published work, so that readers of the preprint get a notification that they are not reading the most up-to-date version.","title":"Feedback and updating"},{"location":"open-science/open-access-info.html#do-i-always-have-to-publish-a-preprint","text":"Of course not: you determine when to publish a preprint.

In an OSF project, you can: - Register a preregistration - Register a preprint - Store and share project documentation - Link external services, such as git(hub) repositories, publication packages, Research Drive (owncloud) folders, etc. - ... and much more, such as obtaining Open science badges! . See this link for more information on the functionality of OSF and the OSF guides for many FAQs and technical documentation. Recommended use of the OSF We recommend using the OSF as a central place for your project, especially if you will produce multiple publications in a project. Link your OSF project to the SYNC lab OSF page (Log in > Components > Link Projects). No worries, the SYNC lab collaborators cannot automatically edit your linked project! Register preregistrations (Registrations > New registration) and Preprints in the relevant components. If your preregistration concerns one manuscript, we recommend creating a separate component in which you link all relevant materials (publication package, preregistration, code, preprint if applicable, etc.) belonging to that manuscript. A project can contain multiple Registrations and Preprints. Be sure to provide good metadata, preferably choose a CC BY 4.0 license and create a DOI so that your preregistration is citable. Data : you can link OSF with external storage (see below) or store data on the OSF itself (choose the German storage). On the OSF itself, there is no storage limit (max.file size is currently 5 GB), but please do take privacy into account at all times Code and software : you can link OSF with a Github repository in case your preprocessing pipeline, processing steps or experimental files are stored there (see below). If your code is however not code-worthy, we recommend storing the code in the publication package or on OSF itself. Link your OSF profile to your ORCID account so that there cannot be any confusion as to who you are. Connecting the OSF to external services Via the Add-on tab, you can connect the OSF with several external services. Note that this will not store data on the OSF itself! SURF Research Drive (via Owncloud) Connecting with an Owncloud service like the Research Drive goes via a WebDAV connection. All changes made in the selected Research Drive folder will become visible in the OSF component, but the data are still stored at the EUR. Note that you can only make 1 Research Drive connection per OSF component (multiple connections per project are possible). Please note the following: Make sure the access level is read-only, unless you want your collaborators to be able to adjust the Research Drive contents Think about anonymity: if you make the project/component public, data that are shared have to be anonymous or consented by participants to share publicly Linking an Owncloud folder is not a FAIR solution: there is no curated metadata and no license. Also, the Research Drive is not meant to archive data after the project is finished, so this will always be a temporary solution. How to link a Research Drive folder to OSF Create a WebDAV password in Research Drive (Account > Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords). Copy the WebDAV password you created and click \"done\" Go to the component in your OSF project in which you want to add the Research Drive folder (if you are not in the right component, the Research Drive folder will be linked to the incorrect location) Select \u201cAdd-on\u201d to add the ownCloud Add-on in OSF Configure the add-on in OSF: URL: https://eur.data.surfsara.nl Username: erna-id@eur.nl Password: WebDAV password you just made Figshare or a publication package in the EDR You can link 1 publication package (1 Figshare link) per OSF component, so that the publication package appears in your OSF project.

Git is a version control system: it tracks the history as you change files. More specifically, it tracks who made which changes and when. It allows reverting files to a previous state. Note that it is possible to work on git projects locally without ever using github. Github is a git hosting platform that you can use to collaborate on projects that use git. It additionally allows for threaded discussions (issues), pull requests and several github apps. Installation Create a Github account (or log on) Become member of the EUR-synclab organization Install git locally (click here for instructions for RStudio ) and some Markdown editor (see below) The git workflow When working on a git project (within a folder called a git repository ), you will always perform the following steps: Make changes to some file Commit the changes: make a snapshot of the changes made so far. A commit (snapshot) is always accompanied by a commit message explaining what changes were made Any commit gets a specific identifier that can be used to reverse (undo) the commit. Branches A git repository can exist in multiple \u201cversions\u201d which are called branches . There is always a \u201cmaster\u201d branch, which you should consider the clean branch. Besides that, you can create other branches that are meant to make your own changes. After you have made changes in your own branch and you think they should be incorporated in the master branch, you can then merge your branch with the master branch. Workflow on github On Github, the workflow is a bit more extensive, because often you are collaborating and do not want others to just start editing the master branch right away. There are multiple methods to collaborate on a project, but we recommend the following, assuming that there is already a repository for the project and you want to contribute: On the repository page on Github, fork the repository: this creates a copy of the repository on your own Github account that you have full access to In your repository, create a new branch for the changes you are about to make with a short but comprehensible name, e.g. \u201cdorienwritecontent\u201d. Skip this step if you are editing online : If you want to edit files locally, clone your repository to your local PC, creating a folder in your file explorer (the contents of which can change according to which branch you are on!). You can use the command line or a tool such as Rstudio or GitKraken to do this. Edit the files you want to edit and commit the changes (making a snapshot; include a commit message!) Skip this step if you are editing online : You have now committed changes locally, but they are not yet visible in your \u201cremote\u201d repository, i.e., the online github repository on your account. In order to get the commits to be visible online, you need to push them to your remote repository on Github. Now the changes are visible in your own account, but not in the main repository. In order to get your changes into the main repository, you need to do a pull request . This is a request to the owners of the original repository to merge your branch with theirs . Once merged by the owners, you are often prompted to remove your own branch (which is not necessary if you are planning to make more changes later). Keeping your local copy (clone) up to date If you are working on a project with many collaborators making changes, the odds are that your own fork (online copy) and/or clone (local copy) are becoming out-of-date quite fast. Therefore, it is recommended to update those copies each time before you start making changes yourself, so you are certain that you are working on the most recent versions of the files. Not recommended : Online (in your fork), you can do this by doing a reverse pull request: a request to yourself to merge the owner\u2019s master branch (\u201cupstream master\u201d) into your own branch that you will be working in. Recommended: In your clone (offline), you can set up the owner\u2019s master branch (\u201cupstream master\u201d) as the upstream master and pull changes from the upstream master (see this page for command-line instructions and this page when you use RStudio). You are simply pulling all changes made to your local PC this way. To update your online version of the repository, simply push the changes (e.g., push origin master ) after pulling from the upstream master (the owner's master branch).

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. Every .md (Markdown) file in this repository in fact uses Markdown for formatting! For example, to indicate a second-level header, you type: ## Title of header Advantages of Markdown: It can be used for a lot of things, e.g., for creating html pages It is platform- and operating system independent You can type markdown in any text editor and open .md files with many programs, such as Atom , Zettlr , Rstudio , Typora , online (e.g., Dillinger ) or even in Word ( Writage tool ). See this page for more tools that support Markdown. Markdown resources Markdown guide Cheatsheet More advanced Markdown tricks How to contribute? The easy (but not recommended) way fork the repository to your own Github account by clicking the button on the upper right of the repository: Make edits to the files you want to edit in your browser by clicking the pencil at the top right of a file. All editable .md files can be found in the docs folder Write a commit message for your changes and click Commit changes . After having made all the changes you wanted, go to the tab Pull requests > New pull request . Make sure the base repository is eur-synclab/sync-manual master and head repository is your own repository, e.g., DorienHuijjser/sync-manual branchinwhichyoumadechanges . Click Create pull request Your pull request will now appear in the eur-synclab repository list of pull requests . If you want, you can assign someone to review your pull request. One of the owners of the repository will review your commits, may request changes and will finally approve the pull request and merge your changes into the eur-synclab/sync-manual master branch. The better way fork the repository to your own Github account by clicking the button on the upper right of the repository: Create a new branch in your forked repository which you will use to make changes in (so your master branch will stay\"clean\"): clone your forked repository to your local PC ( using the command-line or Rstudio ) Make local changes. You can open a .md file in the docs folder with multiple text editors such as Typora, Atom, Zettlr, Rstudio, etc.) and, after saving your changes, commit them ( command-line : git commit -a -m \"commit message\" , RStudio . Your changes are now saved locally. Push your commits to your \u201cremote\u201d (online) repository ( using the command-line : git push origin branchname , in Rstudio ) Follow steps 4-7 explained in the Easy way Important: the next time you start working locally, first update your local version of the repository to the most recent version (Command line: git pull upstream [branchname] [be sure to set the upstream repository first], RStudio ). The most advanced way Follow the installation steps for mkdocs here Follow steps 1-4 explained in The better way In your prompt , navigate to your repository directory with cd C:/users/username/your/repo/directory and run mkdocs serve . This creates a URL (something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/) which you can open in your internet browser. Here, you can see all changes that you make directly \"live\". Press Cntrl+C to stop this operation. Run mkdocs build . If everything goes correctly, you can now also open the new .html files in the sync-manual/site folder to see what your changes will look like in the browser. These files have to be created in order for the website to work on others' computers. Follow step 5-7 explained in The better way. Add yourself as a contributor! Go to this Github issue . Type a comment asking the all-contributors bot to add you (use template mentioned in the issue), look for appropriate emojis here . The bot will open a pull request to add you as contributor. After merging with the master branch, your face will appear in the README.md ! Issues and Projects If you would like to see a change that requires more work or input from others before you can start editing yourself, you can open an Issue . There are some great features about Issues: You can assign people to the Issue who should solve it or provide input You can add the issue to a project. In the tab Projects , you can find our Kanban board in which we have made the columns \u201cTo do\u201d, \u201cIn progress\u201d and \u201cDone\u201d. We made this so we have an overview of Issues that still need work and issues that are in progress. You can add labels to an Issue (please do so!) to specify what kind of issue you are writing After the issue has been solved, you can Close it manually. However, if you made a pull request that solves the issue, you can simply comment Closes #issuenr in the pull request.
