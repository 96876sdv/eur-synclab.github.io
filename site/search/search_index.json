After being registered, they will appear on your profile page and are used for your performance review (R&O gesprek). How do I register publications in Metis? Go to Personal Metis via https://metis.ru.nl/federation/login/personalmetis and log in with your ERNA id and password. Have a look at your results overview and check if all your publications are listed and correctly registered. Register your article in Metis within 6 months after publication (detailed instructions here) make sure to include: Title, Author(s), DOI, Email address of the corresponding EUR author, Faculty, research groups, etc. of the corresponding EUR author, Journal, Abstract (if not available in the running text), Subject headings/keywords (if not available in the running text) upload the final author version (aka postprint: the final version without the publisher\u2019s formatting) of the publication to RePub: this way, the article will become freely accessible via the green route. The library always does a final copyright check before inclusion in the database. Once registered in Metis and placed in RePub, the article receives a permanent identifier in the form of a handle, which you can use to refer to your publication when it is not gold open access. Open access: costs Publishing open access via the green route (RePub) is free of charge and highly encouraged Publishing gold open access is not always free. The VSNU has made deals with several publishers which allows researchers at Dutch universities to publish articles open access at no extra charge. However, not all publishers will point you towards this option when submitting an article or when the article is in the stage of acceptance. To check whether the journal is eligible for open access at no extra charge, see https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/publisher-deals or http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/eurbrowser?q=* In case a journal is not on this list and there is no funding from a project to cover the open access fees, there is an Erasmus Open Access Fund that can cover the fee.

In the SYNC lab, we aim to make all of our publications open access via one or more of the routes described below (green route and sometimes the golden route, preprints are published whenever deemed necessary). Why should I publish open access? - Scientific work is often financed by public funds (tax payers) and therefore should be accessible to the general public - Scientific results get more visible and their use is increased. This can eventually lead to a greater number of citations and thus more impact - Some financers reward researchers that practice open science and sometimes require articles to be published open access (e.g., NWO, Horizon2020 and ERC) Routes to open access Publishing open access is possible via the gold and the green routes, explained below. Gold route: open access with a journal The gold route to open access means that you publish your publication in open access directly via a journal, making the contents of your publication accessible without any obstacles. Often, the author or institution pays an Article Processing Charge (APC) in order to make the article freely accessible immediately. In the Netherlands, large deals can often make sure that you don't have to pay this APC yourself! Publishing via the golden route can either go via an open access journal or in a hybrid journal. A hybrid journal still uses the traditional subscription model, but has added an open access option for which you need to pay extra. Since 2015, the NWO does not grant reimbursements anymore for publications in such hybrid journals. According to Plan S, the open access journals have to fulfill several requirements that you can find here . Green route: publishing in a repository Publishing via the green route (\"self-archiving\") entails making your publication available at a repository besides publishing it via a traditional journal. Repositories are freely accessible data storages of scientific articles and theses. Each repository should be registered in the Directory of Open Access Repositories ( OpenDOAR ). The repository of the EUR is Repub . The EUR requires that you always upload your article in Repub . Do publishers allow this? That depends on the version of your publication: - A preprint, i.e., the version that you send to the journal before peer review, is always allowed - A postprint is what you have to upload to Repub: it is the final version of your article (after peer review) without the publisher's layout and typeset - Self-archiving the version of record (publisher version) is least often allowed You can check the journal policies in Sherpa/Romeo . Preprints Publishing preprints is a form of self-archiving and can help in getting your results out there quicker. Please be aware that preprints could in theory be flawed because they are not peer reviewed. Therefore, be sure to prepare your submission well , to protect your own reputation in the scientific community. Why publish preprints? Speed : Preprints are publicly readable and do not take long to publish (besides some checks on scientific content and ethical compliance). This means your impact is immediate! Greater reach/visibility : because preprints are open access and many preprint servers are indexed by search engines (e.g., Google Scholar), the odds of reaching more people with your work increase. Some servers, such as bioRxiv, even tweet about all of their preprints. Feedback : Another reason may be to get more input on your work: it is not the final version and is therefore already subject to change, so why not take advantage of that? Prevent scooping : preprints are timestamped, so by posting it, you have established precedence! Individual benefits : such as showing your productivity to the world, showing that you are open to feedback (i.e. open attitude), staking intellectual claims to the methods, results and ideas, etc. Where to publish preprints? For example in OSF Preprints (not field specific, allows sharing supplementary files), or directly via BioRxiv, PsyArXiv or SocArXiv. You can even add a preprint on ResearchGate ! Choose whichever fits your topic and community best. A list of preprint servers hosted via OSF Preprints can be found here . Feedback and updating There are different ways researchers can give feedback on preprints: - In OSF preprints, you can use their tool Hypothes.is to annotate preprints, see their help guide - You can share contact information and send feedback to each other - Some servers offer comment functionalities (e.g., when logged in) - Use (academic) twitter What you do with feedback is completely up to you. If you want, you can update your preprint to a new version. However, note that all versions are timestamped and retained . Often new versions get a new identifier (DOI) and old versions cannot be removed! If your work gets published by a publisher, many preprint servers also offer the possibility to refer to the identifier (DOI) of your published work, so that readers of the preprint get a notification that they are not reading the most up-to-date version. Do I always have to publish a preprint? Of course not: you determine when to publish a preprint. Reasons for publishing a preprint can be: - The journal in which you want to publish has too few open access options but you still want everyone to be able to read your findings - You want your work to be part of the scientific community fast - You are looking for more feedback on your work than just the feedback provided by peer review - You want to show how open science minded you are","title":"Information"},{"location":"open-science/open-access-info.html#open-access-publishing","text":"Open access publishing means that everyone has access to your manuscripts, no matter where they are in the world and no matter if they have a journal subscription.
