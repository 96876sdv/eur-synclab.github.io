# Welcome to the SYNC lab wiki



Welcome! You are reading the first page of the SYNC lab wiki. This wiki is a **collaborative and living document**, where we plan to provide information about how to work in the [SYNC lab (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected)](https://erasmus-synclab.nl/).


### What can I find on this wiki?

On this wiki you can find:
- our current agenda surrounding stand-ups, lab meetings, and journal clubs
- the Open Science Stempelkaart, including more information on open science practices. In depth supporting information can be found under Data Management.
- resources for presentations, such as the SYNC lab Powerpoint template, can be found under Outreach
- further practical information surrounding the EUR can be found under Getting started at the EUR


### Why this wiki?

- It is a searchable guide for all members of the SYNC lab 
- It can be updated by all lab members
- It is easier to keep up to date than a zillion different Word documents 
- It gives transparent insight in how we work as a lab


### How to use this wiki?

This wiki is primarily meant for employees of the SYNC-lab, but can be used by other researchers too, if desired.

Click on a chapter in the menu bar that you would like to read more about, or use the search bar!
