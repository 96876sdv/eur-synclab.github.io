# Welcome to the SYNC lab wiki



Welcome! You are reading the first page of the SYNC lab wiki. This wiki is a **collaborative and living document**, where we plan to provide information about how to work in the [SYNC lab (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected)](https://erasmus-synclab.nl/).



### Why this wiki?

- It is a searchable guide for all members of the SYNC lab 
- It can be updated by all lab members
- It is easier to keep up to date than a zillion different Word documents 


### How to use this wiki?

This wiki is primarily meant for employees of the SYNC-lab, but can be used by other researchers too, if desired.

Click on a chapter in the menu bar that you would like to read more about, or use the search bar!

#### Adding new stuff

- If you are missing information here, and you think someone else could write a page about that topic, suggest it as an [Issue](https://github.com/eur-synclab/eur-synclab.github.io/issues) on the Github repository or just ask someone by mail / Slack/ in real life!
