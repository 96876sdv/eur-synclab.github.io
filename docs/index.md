# Welcome to the SYNC lab wiki



Welcome! You are reading the first page of the SYNC lab wiki. This wiki is a **collaborative and living document**, where we plan to provide information about how to work in the SYNC lab (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected).



### Why this wiki?

- It is a searchable guide for all members of the SYNC lab 
- It can be updated by all lab members
- It is easier to keep up to date than a zillion different Word documents 



### How to use this wiki?

This wiki is primarily meant for employees of the SYNC-lab, but can be used by other researchers too, if desired.
