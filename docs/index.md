# Welcome to the SYNC lab wiki



Welcome! You are reading the first page of the SYNC lab wiki. This wiki is a **collaborative and living document**, where we plan to provide information about how to work in the SYNC lab (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected).



### Why this wiki?

- It is a searchable guide for all members of the SYNC lab 
- It can be updated by all lab members
- It is easier to keep up to date than a zillion different Word documents 



### How to use this wiki?

It works best to open the **index.html** file and navigate the manual in your internet browser. In the menu bar, navigate to the chapter that you would like to read more about, or use the search bar!

#### Adding new stuff

- Are you missing information or should current information be updated? Use our [Github repository](https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-manual).
- On the [How to contribute](./welcome/contribute) page, you can find more details on how to use git, Github and Markdown to make contributions.
- If you are missing information here, and you think someone else could write a page about that topic, suggest it as an [Issue](https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-manual/issues) on the Github repository or just ask someone by mail / Slack/ in real life!
