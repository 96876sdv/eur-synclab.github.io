# Welcome to the SYNC lab wiki

### This is a collaborative and living document, where we plan to provide a lot of information about how to work in the SYNC lab.

### Why this manual?
- it is a searchable guide
- it can be updated by all labmembers
- easier to keep up to date than zillion different Word docs 

### How to use?
- It works best to open the index.html file and navigate the manual in your internet browser
- want to add something or suggest changes? Use Github: [ https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-manual](https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-manual)
