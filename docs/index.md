# Welcome to the SYNC lab wiki



Welcome! You are reading the first page of the SYNC lab wiki. This wiki is a **collaborative and living document**, where we plan to provide information about how to work in the SYNC lab (Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected).



### Why this wiki?

- It is a searchable guide for all members of the SYNC lab 
- It can be updated by all lab members
- It is easier to keep up to date than a zillion different Word documents 



In the menu bar, navigate to the chapter that you would like to read more about, or use the search bar!

Are you missing information or should current information be updated? Read how to contribute [here](../welcome/contribute.md).
