# DMP & DPIA

On this page, you can find more information about the Data Management Plan (DMP) and the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).



## Data management plan (DMP)

Since 2016, all research projects must have a **data management plan (DMP)** before the start of the project. In a DMP, you are forced to think about data management during and after your project. In a data management plan, you capture which data and metadata will be collected, who is responsible for which tasks and what will happen to the (meta)data after the project has ended.

### Why write a DMP?

-	Organize the way you will create, organize, store, preserve and share your data
-	Demonstrate your funder/employer that you know how to handle your data
-	Identify the best tools for your research ánd disclose potential data issues
-	Be glad procedures are recorded in cases of confusion or forgetfulness (e.g., who can have access, who is responsible, what will happen with the data?)



### Components of a DMP

Fairly standard components of a DMP are:

<ul><li><b>Cover information</b>: project name, researchers, dates, ethical protocol numbers, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Data collection and creation</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>How will you create your data?</li>
        <li>How will you access the data in the future?</li>
        <li>What license will you use?</li>
        <li>What kind of data will it be? E.g., how many and what type of files (see <a href=https://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/services/easy/information-about-depositing-data/before-depositing/file-formats>preferred file formats</a>), how large (search for "file size calculator"), data quality (resolution, quality), usefulness (versions/processed or unprocessed)</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Data storage and security</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Where will you store your data?</li>
        <li>Where and how often will you make back-ups (1 copy offsite, 3 copies, 2 different media)?</li>
        <li>What do you do to make sure that the right people can access your data? (passwords, encryption, firewalls, anonymization, aggregation, secure transport and deletion, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Documentation and metadata</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>How are your files named and structured?</li>
        <li>Are you using version control?</li>
        <li>Are you providing readme files and/or other documentation? (e.g., time, place, people involved, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Data access, sharing and reuse</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>With whom do you want to share your data? How/where?</li>
        <li>Has ownership been agreed?</li>
        <li>Who might find your data useful later?</li>
        <li>Any restrictions regarding data sharing? Reasons to opt out of sharing with others: privacy / personal data (GDPR), intellectual property rights, might jeopardize the project’s main objective, commercial (working for companies), security-related, etc.</li>
        <li>Think about linking your data to your publication AND vice versa! Also think about linking your publications to you through an <a href=https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/research-and-publishing/scholarly-publishing/manage-your-name-with-identifiers>ORCID-ID</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Data preservation and archiving</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Which data do you want to keep for future use? Which data will you discard? Not all data necessarily need to be preserved!</li>
        <li>Where are you going to archive these data?</li>
        <li>How to organize the data so that they can still be understood in the future?</li>
        <li>Who is responsible for your data after you leave?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### How to write a DMP?

At the EUR, you can use the [DMP Online tool](https://dmponline.eur.nl/), which contains DMP templates of a lot of funders.

<ul>
    <li>Create an account, select the (funder specific) format and simply fill out the form! </li>
    <ul>
        <li>If you leave the Funder field empty, you will use the general EUR-format.</li>
        <li>Note that not all funders may have approved the EUR template! Contact Geert van den Hoek or the Erasmus Data Serve Centre to be sure</li>
    </ul>
    <li>You can also invite colleagues to work on the DMP and leave comments</li>
    <li>If your research is funded by the NWO, you have to use one of their approved templates and get feedback from an expert (see contacts below)</li>
</ul>

##### Tips for your DMP

-	Plan for at least 10 years of storage and check the associated costs
-	Check what file formats are most suitable for long-term archiving (preferably not closed, software-specific formats such as .sav, but open formats such as .csv)
-	Ask what repository/storage system others with similar data are using
-	Think about how you will grant access: will people always have to ask permission or can the data be open?
-	Ensure the data is **documented** so that others can understand it later
- Update the DMP whenever you are deviating from earlier versions



## Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)

Whenever you process sensitive data (or something changes regarding this), such as MRI data, names, addresses, daily diaries, etc., you are required to fill in a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) that has to be approved before starting your study by a [privacy officer](mailto:privacy@essb.eur.nl). In a DPIA, you identify privacy risks and formulate measures to prevent breaches. You register which data you collect and who is responsible. A DPIA touches upon:

<ul>
    <li>Collaborations in your project:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Within your institute</li>
        <li>Between institutes: agree upon who has access to the data and which technologies are used (e.g., for saving and analyzing the data)</li>
        <li>Public-private collaborations: make contractual agreements about how to handle data</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Geography: outside of the EU, you need to make contractual agreements about how to handle data</li>
    <li>Types of data collected:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatically generated (e.g., fitness watches)</li>
        <li>Own creation, e.g., interviews, pictures</li>
        <li>Re-used, e.g., multiple datasets combined (pay attention to identifiability)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
