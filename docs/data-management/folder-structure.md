# Folder structure

It is important to have a folder structure that provides a good overview of your project and that maintains all data and documentation of your project logically. Important aspects of a good project structure are:

1. Separate source and **raw data from further processed data**. Preferably make raw data read-only so they cannot be edited.
2. Separate different **types of data**, when necessary
3. Provide scripts or descriptions that were used to go from the raw data to all processed data > make sure your analyses from start to finish are **reproducible**! 
4. Provide sufficient **metadata** about your project, e.g., preregistrations, study protocol, codebooks/data dictionaries, a data management plan, general information about the project, the ethics protocol, etc.
5. Provide all **materials and instructions** used to collect the data, e.g., tasks, questionnaires and instructions
6. Overall: use self-explanatory **file and folder names** or provide documentation explaining which files can be found where. Also keep in mind **versioning** (e.g., use the date in the filenames, the version or use a formal version control system like git)
7. Finally, use your folders **consistently**, e.g., place all data in the Data folder.



Below, you can find an example folder structure:

        </details>
        </details>
    </details>
</details>

### Another type of dropdown: edit the text, or make it clickable?



<div class="dropdown">
            <button class="btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" id="Abouttheproject" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
              About the project
            </button>
            <ul class="dropdown-menu multi-level" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenu">
                <li class="dropdown-item">Preregistration(s) and/or study protocol (or links to them)</li>
        		<li class="dropdown-item">Data dictionary/codebook</li>
         		<li class="dropdown-item">Data management plan (DMP) and/or Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)</li>

        		 <li class="dropdown-item">Organizational files about planning, availability, task divisioin, etc.</li>
              </ul>
        </div>
