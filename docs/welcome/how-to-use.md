# How to use this lab wiki?

### Reading and exploring
- It works best to open the index.html file and navigate the manual in your internet browser

### Adding new stuff
- Want to add something or suggest changes? Use the lab wiki Github repository: [ https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-manual](https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-manual)
- In the [How to contribute](../welcome/contribute.md) pages you can find more details on how to use git, Github and Markdown to make contributions
- If you are missing information here, and you think someone else could write a page about that topic, suggest it as an [Issue](https://github.com/eur-synclab/sync-manual/issues) on the Github repository or just ask someone by mail / Slack/ in real life
