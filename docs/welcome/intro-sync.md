# The SYNC lab
### **SYNC** stands for **Society, Youth and Neuroscience Connected**

For more information on the SYNC lab, visit [the SYNC website](https://erasmus-synclab.nl/)

Our **mission** is to bridge multiple levels of measurement to understand how young people develop into contributing members of society. The SYNC lab is firmly grounded in exciting new perspectives that have emerged from understanding the dynamic development of the adolescent brain.

Our **vision** is that science becomes better when conducted together with societal partners, including youth panels, schools, and co-creation teams. We also strongly believe in interdisciplinary research teams; therefore, we work with researchers from different scientific disciplines, including the social sciences, life sciences, and humanities. Moreover, the Erasmus SYNC lab embraces Open Science through practices such as pre-registration, data sharing and open-access publishing. Together, we hope we can work on providing the scientific building blocks needed to help shape a better future for the current and next generation of youth.

At the Erasmus-SYNC lab we speak up against racism and strive to enable equality. The Erasmus University Rotterdam aspires to be an inclusive organization where everyone feels at home and therefore get the opportunity to excel. Talent is the basis; diversity is the added value. We believe in the enrichment that a mix of different people bring. We aim to connect **all of society**: regardless of origin, skin color, gender, education level, or sexual preference.
