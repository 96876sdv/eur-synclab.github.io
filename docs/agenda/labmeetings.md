# Labmeetings

Currently, we meet at regular intervals for different purposes:
- Weekly stand-up
- Labmeetings
- Data management meetings
- Journal clubs



## Attending our meetings

If you would like to attend one of our meetings as attendee or guest speaker, please feel free to send us an email via [this contact form](https://erasmus-synclab.nl/contact/). 



## Stand-up

The weekly stand-up is meant to keep each other up to date on our work (and sometimes personal) activities and to ask for help when needed. We all shortly state what we are doing and note whether or not we have something we need help with.  



## Labmeetings

In the labmeetings, labmembers or external visitors share their latest results or ideas for new research. It is a great opportunity to get feedback in a supportive and welcoming environment. Lab meetings can also be used to practice a (conference) talk.

Collaborators from outside the SYNC lab are more than welcome for labmeetings where research from the specific collaboration is discussed. So do not forget to invite your collaborators when presenting!

## Journal clubs

Starting November 2022, we have planned several journal clubs about specific topics, focused on theoretical and methodological papers. This allows us to dive deeper into theoretical aspects of our work and remain up to date with current literature. Example topics from the past are theories on social media in adolescence and the importance of effect sizes in scientific research.
