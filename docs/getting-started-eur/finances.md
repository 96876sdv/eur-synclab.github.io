# Finances

On this page, you can find practical information on declaring payments for different purposes. The WBS numbers to declare on can be found in [this Research Drive document](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/14754513).



## Paying a large group of participants

The procedure for letting large groups of participants get paid is currently as followed:

1. Ask participants to fill in a receipt (kwitantie) with their contact details and signature (see an example format in [this Research Drive file](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/6736927)). Keep the receipt in a safe place, because you have to be able to show it in case of checks.
2. Fill in the form "[Form_for_paying_participants_explained.xls](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/4519282)" (on Research Drive) after copying it (only sheet "1", remove the example line). Follow the instructions in the document closely.
3. Save the form as .xls ánd as .pdf with a recognizable name, e.g., "20200421_Brainlinks_payment_T2.5_corona".
4. Have the relevant budget keeper (procuratiehouder) sign the pdf (see the [Research Drive document](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/14754513) for who to ask, usually Eveline is the one to sign)
5. Send both the .xsl and the .pdf to Patricia Engelbrecht (*patricia.engelbrecht@eur.nl*), preferably via [SURF filesender](https://filesender.surf.nl/), considering there are personal data in the documents.
6. Patricia will feed the .xls form to the system. If something doesn't work, it has been filled in wrongly and she will return the document to you. When it does work, all participants from the file will receive payment simultaneously.



Notes:

- It is undesirable to imburse participants with the money with your own money and then declaring it via the ESS portal. The ESS portal is not suitable for this kind of declaration, since it asks for very specific proof of payment.
- Depending on the amount of money that needs to be paid, there may be a different budget keeper (e.g., someone for amounts below €1000, etc.).



## Paying small numbers of individuals

If the amount of participants or other persons to imburse is not that large, there is another way. This is for example the case when reimbursing travel costs or paying student assistants for extra jobs.

- Copy the form "[Example_payment_natural_persons.xlsx](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/5866306)" or, if the individuals do not work at EUR, the form "[Declaration_form_non-EUR_individuals_NL.pdf](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/s/Vk5H7unUGqr92Nc)"
- Fill in the relevant data and correct the Kostenplaats/WBS element
- Send the form to *invoice [dot] fin [at] eur [dot] nl*. It will then land in the portal and be processed by finance



## Invoices

If an external company requires payment using an invoice, let them address the invoice to:

&#8195;Erasmus University Rotterdam<br>

&#8195;Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences<br>

&#8195;PO Box 1738<br>

&#8195;3000 DR Rotterdam<br>



Email the invoice to *invoice [dot] fin [at] eur [dot] nl* and mention the WBS element or Kostenplaats under which it should fall.



## Other declarations

### Travel costs (home-work)

EUR automatically gives you travel cost reimbursement via your paycheck based on the distance you have to travel to work (read more [here](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/hr/terms-employment/financial-matters-and-allowances/allowances/commuting/travel-expenses-kilometre-allowance-scheme)). However, if you use public transport, there is an extra regulation that can reimburse a higher amount if needed (up to €250 for full-time employment). You can request this regulation via the ESS portal, read more about it [here](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/hr/terms-employment/financial-matters-and-allowances/allowances/commuting/travel-expenses-scheme-public-transport).



### Conference and other research-related costs

If you have made costs that do not relate to home-work travel costs, invoices or paying participants, such as conference fees or research materials, you can declare them via the ESS portal.
