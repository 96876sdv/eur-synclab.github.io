# Time registration

## What is time registration?

The hours you work for a project should be registered daily or weekly in the correct WBS element (kostenplaats). The hours that you cannot register on a project will go on the general kostenplaats (or on a blank line). 

- For administration purposes it is important that you register your hours **before** the 4th day of the next month
- If you are late, you will receive reminders
- Sick days will be automatically registered by HR
- National holidays and requested vacation days will also be automatically processed after your request is granted



## Why time registration?

Both for justifying costs for funders and for the EUR's administration, the correct costs should be linked to the correct project, even if you are only working on (being paid by) one project.



## How?

- Go to the [ESS portal](https://ess.eur.nl) (Employee Self Service)
- Click "Tijdschrijven" (Time registration)
- Within the Tijdschrijven menu, navigate to the week in which you want to register worked hours.
- Choose an empty line
- Fill in the WBS number or Kostenplaats (i.e., the source of your paycheck), check them [here](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/14754513) (link to Research Drive)
- Your labor contract (arbeidsovereenkomst) will automatically appear if you only work on one
- Fill in the hours you worked each day
- Save your changes

If you always work the same hours during the week, you can also make a **template**:

- Fill in the week as you would want to save it
- Save your week as template (Sjabloon /Template > Opslaan als sjabloon/Save as template)
- To apply the template to a new week, navigate to a new week and click "Werkvoorraad" to copy the template from the previous period

</br>

### Important notes

- You can only navigate **6 weeks** in the past. Hours that have not been justified before that time can only be registered by Project Control.
- The first line in the ESS portal contains your norm hours. You have to justify all those hours to prevent errors
- If you log on twice or try to open the window twice you will get the error: "Your personnel number is blocked at the moment"
