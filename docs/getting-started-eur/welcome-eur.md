6. performance and development (R&O) interview documents. Go to "Mijn R&O" and create a progress form for the interview.

Academic staff has to complement this form with a publication list and educational evaluations (differs per department). After the interview and after you have agreed on the terms, send the form to HR. Read [more here](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/hr/career-and-development/performance-development).

## ICT-related know-how

Read all about your ICT workplace [here](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/work-support/ict-workplace). 

- If you want to **work from home**, use [MyApps](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/services/working-flex-workspace-or-home), which allows you access to your personal account (@wEURk workplace) and software. Please note that MyApps is not coupled to a specific PC, so you cannot use local hard disk storage of a specific EUR PC from home. Read more FAQs [here](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/work-support/ict-workplace/faq-myapps).
- You can install software via the Software Center (locally or via MyApps). There is more software available than is visible here, see [this page](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/work-support/ict-workplace/client-software-center-application-request) for more information.
