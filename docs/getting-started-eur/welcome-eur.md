### MyApps

Since 2021, the EUR requires that you use their network to browse at least the following platforms:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ess.eur.nl/" target="_blank">ESS portal</a>: Self service portal, see manuals <a href="https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/hr/self-service-and-hr-contacts/employee-self-service-portal-ess" target="_blank">here</a>. This portal is for, a.o. requesting vacation days, requesting extra travel cost reimbursement (My administration > Extra travel reimbursement), making declarations, <a href=time-registration.md>time registration</a>, seeing paychecks, performance and development (R&O) interview documents.
    <ul><li><b>R&O</b>: Go to "Mijn R&O" and create a progress form for the interview. You can already fill in this form before the interview; your changes are immediately visible to your employer. Academic staff have to complement this form with additional documents. After the interview and after you have agreed on the terms, send the form to HR. Read <a href="https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/hr/career-and-development/performance-development" target="_blank">more here</a>.</li></ul>
<li><a href="https://pure.eur.nl/" target="_blank">Pure</a>, the system used to register academic output and to change your EUR profile. Please see <a href="https://my.eur.nl/nl/eur-employee/handleidingen-pure" target="_blank">here</a> for relevant manuals. </li>
</ul>

#### MyApps - How to

To access these platforms, you can use ["MyApps"](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/services/working-flex-workspace-or-home). MyApps is a type of Remote desktop connection that can be set up between your PC and the Erasmus University network. If you (used to) work at Leiden University, it is comparable to Citrix in that you can access the network, some software and the files, but you are not working directly on a PC and can only access the files on the server (not on a local disk). Read FAQs about MyApps [here](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/services/myapps-remote-desktop-connection).

To set up a connection, user [this user guide](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/media/2020-02-instruction-and-basic-userguide-myapps).

Within MyApps, it is possible to start a Remote desktop session with a physical PC at the EUR (and thus you'll be able to access a local disk). To do so:

1. Ask IT servicedesk to enable the Remote desktop connection for your PC, because this is currently not automatically enabled for all EUR PCs
2. When enabled, open a MyApps session
3. **Within the MyApps session**, click the magnifying class at the bottom of your screen to search for "Remote Desktop Connection"
4. In the screen that opens, type the complete network name from the PC in the format CL#########.campus.eur.nl.
5. If entered correctly, you can now log in with your ERNA ID and use your local PC from home!
