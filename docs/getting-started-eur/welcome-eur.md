- If you want to **work from home**, use [MyApps](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/services/working-flex-workspace-or-home), which allows you access to your personal account (@wEURk workplace) and software. Please note that MyApps is not coupled to a specific PC, so you cannot use local hard disk storage of a specific EUR PC from home.

- You can install software via the Software Center (locally or via MyApps). There is more software available than is visible here, see [this page](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur-employee/work-support/ict-workplace/client-software-center-application-request) for more information.
