# Using the Lisa cluster

If you want to process a lot of data, using a high performance cluster will save a lot of time. We can use the [Lisa Cluster](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa) from SURFsara
More information about high perfomance computing options at the EUR can be found [here](https://www.eur.nl/en/library/node/20736)

## Obtaining an account

- See also under 'How to Access' on this [EUR page](https://www.eur.nl/en/library/node/20736):
	
    1. Download the [application form](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/sites/default/files/2015-11-11-Lisa-Application-form-EUR.doc) for resources at SURFsara, fill it in and return it for EUR approval by e-mail to [edsc@eur.nl](mailto:edsc@eur.nl?SUBJECT=High%20Performance%20Computing). You can ask for 10.000 hours computing time for a start, this will normally be approved quite fast 
    2. After EUR approval: SURFsara requests you, for each user in the Application form to sign the [Usage agreement Supercomputer systems](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/sites/default/files/2013-01-25_HPC-System-Usage-Agreement-SURFsara.doc), and send it to [helpdesk@surfsara.nl](mailto:helpdesk@surfsara.nl)
    3. At SURFsara they will create an account for you on LISA and you will receive an email with instructions on how to login

## SLURM usage

Lisa runs a Unix-based operating system, which is text based. For submitting batches of jobs, SLURM is used.
There is a dedicated Lisa [User Guide](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa/user-guide), here are some basics that are good to know:
