# Data sharing agreement

## What is a data sharing agreement?

A data sharing agreement can be set up between the owner of research data and someone with whom data is shared or who will process the data further. Important components of such an agreement are that the receiver of the data will not try to identify the participants and will not share the data with third parties. This leaves a high degree of control for the data owner concerning who has access to the data.

## When to use a data sharing agreement?

- The data cannot be made entirely anonymous (i.e., you have pseudonymized data), **AND**
- The participant has given explicit informed consent to share their data with other researchers

When data can be made entirely anonymous, you do not strictly need a data sharing agreement (although not forbidden of course). When the participant has NOT given explicit informed consent to share their personal data (non-anonymous data), you are legally NOT ALLOWED to share their personal data at all. In the latter case, try to find a way to anonymize the data or do not share the data at all. 

## Who needs to sign the data sharing agreement?
Someone with permission to make lawful decisions under the flag of the university has to sign the agreemement. This should in principle be the Scientific Director ("WD", Wetenschappelijk Directeur), from BOTH institutes involved. However, the Scientific Director can give permission ("volmacht") to others to make those decisions for him/her (e.g., via an email stating this and for how long the permission is given).
