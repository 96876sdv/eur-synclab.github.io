# Publication packages

Publication packages are bundles of all materials necessary to reproduce the results from a scientific article. They roughly contain:

- The manuscript or a link to an open access version
- Experimental files, such as Eprime or scripts that run the experiment, task instructions, questionnaires, etc.
- Raw research data (anonymized) or a link to the repository where the data are stored
- Processed research data (anonymized) or a link to the repository where the data are stored
- Processing and statistical analysis scripts
- Readme file with all relevant metadata, including links to the article and other relevant information, e.g., the preregistration, the dataset on NeuroVault, contact information of involved researchers, etc. The more metadata, the better!
- Approved ethics protocol

See for more extensive information the [national publication package guidelines](https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/sociale-wetenschappen/psychologie/organisatiegids/instruction-for-archiving-publication-packages.pdf).

At the EUR, use the [EUR data repository](https://datarepository.eur.nl/) (instance of Figshare), which is currently only suitable for anonymized data. Your publication package will receive a DOI which can be cited in your publication. Information on how to use the EUR data repository can be found in [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kld9DRSnRBM&list=PL83jqndLu-uALFbLn62Jp3qdh0lwyPXgw&index=1) and [here](https://www.eur.nl/en/library/research-support/research-data-management-rdm/tooling/eur-data-repository).

## Tips

- Be sure to create the publication package (reserve a DOI) before your manuscript is published, so that the manuscript links to the publication package and vice versa
- Prevent uploading files multiple times. If you have already uploaded data or code on OSF or Github, link those uploads to the publication package, instead of re-uploading in the publication package. If you have uploaded elsewhere (e.g., NeuroVault), provide a readme with the relevant links to make sure everything is findable!
- If applicable, create links with an OSF project, a Github repository and your ORCID, click [here](https://www.eur.nl/en/library/research-support/research-data-management-rdm/tooling/eur-data-repository/faq) for how to do this.
- Only zip files when the data files are very large in order to save space. The data is more accessible and interoperable if they are not zipped.
- Publish the package as a dataset, not as an online resource, in order to make the data more findable.
- Only publish data confidential when that is absolutely necessary. The reuse of your data is significantly reduced when they are behind a confidentiality wall. Moreover, when the owner of the publication package leaves the EUR, they cannot provide access to the confidential files anymore.
