On this page, you will find more resources aimed at increasing transparency in your manuscript.

### (e)COBIDAS: Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing
In 2012, in a [review of the methods and results reporting of more than 200 fMRI papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22796459) the author found that *"Although many journals urge authors to describe their methods to a level of detail such that independent investigators can fully reproduce their efforts, the results described here suggest that few studies meet this criterion."*

A few years ago, in order to improve reproducibility in (f)MRI research, the Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS) of OHBM released a [report](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/054262v2) to promote best practices for methods and results reporting. This was recently followed by a [similar initiative for EEG and MEG](https://osf.io/a8dhx/).

The goal of this project is to develop an online version of the checklist to increase the implementation of both reports. See the first version of the online checklist **[here](https://ohbm.github.io/cobidas/#/)**. Other resources:
- OSF page: https://osf.io/anvqy/
