# Transparency checklists

On this page, you will find more resources aimed at increasing transparency in your manuscript.



## Open Project Checklist

Find the Open Project checklist [here](https://tinyurl.com/openchecklist). Note that this is a **work in progress**. The final version will be published on Zenodo. 

You can use this checklist for your project to:

- See where in your research project you can improve your openness
- Check how open you are: an ‚úîÔ∏è apprentice, üí™ master or üèÜ champion



### Transparency checklist (Aczel et al., 2020)

How transparent are you with respect to the process of and around your manuscript? This is what you can use this checklist for. Note that this checklist is not necessarily for your entire project.

### (e)COBIDAS: reproducible methods reporting
A few years ago, in order to improve reproducibility in (f)MRI research, the Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS) of OHBM released a [report](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/054262v2) to promote best practices for **methods and results reporting**. This was recently followed by a [similar initiative for EEG and MEG](https://osf.io/a8dhx/). The goal of eCOBIDAS is to develop an online version of the checklist to increase the implementation of both reports. See the first version of the online checklist **[here](https://ohbm.github.io/eCOBIDAS/#/)** (see also the [OSF page](https://osf.io/anvqy/) and [Github repo](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls))
