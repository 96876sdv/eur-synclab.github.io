# How to publish open access?

## Publishing & green open access at the EUR
You have to register your articles yourself in [Metis](https://metis.ru.nl/federation/login/personalmetis). Read how to do this on [this webpage](https://my.eur.nl/en/essb-employee/research/research-publishing-impact/personal-metis). In short:

- Go to [Personal Metis](https://metis.ru.nl/federation/login/personalmetis) and log in with your ERNA id and password
- Register your article in Metis within 6 months after publication
- Include all relevant details such as Title, Author(s), DOI, Email address of corresponding author, Journal, etc.
- Upload the accepted version of your publication (final author version, without publisher formatting) to [RePub](https://repub.eur.nl/page/1/) (Green route)

  

## Gold open access

- To **check for publisher deals** (APC reimbursement) see the journal browser on https://www.openaccess.nl/ or use the [EUR journal browser](https://www.eur.nl/en/library/research-support/open-access/publisher-deals)
- To check whether the combination of your journal, funder and institution is **compliant with Plan S**, use the [Journal Checker tool](http://journalcheckertool.org/).
- In case a journal is not on this list and there is no funding from a project to cover the open access fees, there is an **Erasmus Open Access Fund** that can cover the fee. For more information please have a look [here](https://www.eur.nl/en/research-support/open-access/erasmus-open-access-fund)



## Use an open license: CC-BY

Journals often offer multiple licensing possibilities. It is best to choose the most open license, preferably **CC-BY 4.0**. Try to **avoid** using non-derivative (ND) and non-commercial (NC) licenses. For more information, check out [this documentation](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4090922) on choosing a license. 



## Use your ORCID

When publishing anything, always use your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/). This allows all your works to be associated with **you**, not someone with accidentally the same name, independent of your work or email address. Read all about ORCID in **this [EUR libguide](https://libguides.eur.nl/ORCID/home).** Some nice-to-knows:

- Institutions have **organization identifiers**. For EUR, use "Erasmus University Rotterdam, Zuid-Holland, NL". 
- **Automatic syncing**: Under "Works" > "Search and link", allow parties like Crossref and DataCite access to your ORCID, so all your works linked to them will appear in your record **automatically**! 
- The **peer review category** appears only if your publisher indicates that or when you use Publons. This will make explicit how much work you spend reviewing.



## Check the quality of an (open access) journal

How do you know whether or not you found a trustworthy (open access) journal for your publication? Please pay attention to the following requirements:

- The journal has an ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)
- The publisher is a member of the [Open Access Scholarly Publisher Association](https://oaspa.org/) and the journal is included in the [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/)
- The journal is connected to or is sponsored by a scientific institute or society
- All articles have a DOI
- The journal is not part of this [list of dubious publishers](https://web.archive.org/web/20170112125427/https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/)
- The content area of the journal is clearly described and the articles are in line with this description
- The target group of the journal are researchers and scientific teachers
- The editorial board consists of renowned/well-known researchers from the discipline
- The costs of publishing open access are clearly mentioned
- The user licenses are clearly mentioned in each article
