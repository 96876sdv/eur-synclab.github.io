# How to publish open access?

## Publishing at the EUR
You have to register your articles yourself in [Metis](https://metis.ru.nl/federation/login/personalmetis). After being registered, they will appear on your profile page and are used for your performance review (R&O gesprek). 

**How do I register publications in Metis?**

- Go to [Personal Metis](https://metis.ru.nl/federation/login/personalmetis) and log in with your ERNA id and password.
- Have a look at your results overview and check if all your publications are listed and correctly registered.
- Register your article in Metis within 6 months after publication (detailed instructions [here](https://my.eur.nl/en/essb-employee/research-0/research-publishing-impact/personal-metis))
  - make sure to include: Title, Author(s), DOI, Email address of the corresponding EUR author, Faculty, research groups, etc. of the corresponding EUR author, Journal, Abstract (if not available in the running text), Subject headings/keywords (if not available in the running text)
  - upload the final author version (aka postprint: the final version without the publisher’s formatting) of the publication to [RePub](https://repub.eur.nl/page/1/): this way, the article will become freely accessible via the green route. The library always does a final copyright check before inclusion in the database.

Once registered in Metis and placed in RePub, the article receives a permanent identifier in the form of a handle, which you can use to refer to your publication when it is not gold open access.

## Open access: costs

- Publishing open access via the green route (RePub or other institutional repository) is free of charge and highly encouraged.
- Publishing gold open access is not always free. The VSNU has made deals with several publishers that allow researchers at Dutch universities to publish articles open access at no extra charge. However, not all publishers will point you towards this option when submitting an article or when the article is in the stage of acceptance. 
- To **check whether the journal is eligible for open access** at no extra charge (or because the APC will be paid by the university), see [this link](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands/publisher-deals) or [the journal browser](http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/eurbrowser?q=*)
- To check whether the combination of your journal, funder and institution is **compliant with Plan S**, use the [Journal Checker tool](http://journalcheckertool.org/).
- In case a journal is not on this list and there is no funding from a project to cover the open access fees, there is an **Erasmus Open Access Fund** that can cover the fee. For more information please have a look [here](https://www.eur.nl/en/research-support/open-access/erasmus-open-access-fund)

## Checking the quality of an (open access) journal

How do you know whether or not you found a trustworthy (open access) journal for your publication? Please pay attention to the following requirements:

- The journal has an ISSN (International Standard Serial Number).
- The publisher is a member of the [Open Access Scholarly Publisher Association](https://oaspa.org/) and the journal is included in the [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/).
- The journal is connected to or is sponsored by a scientific institute or society.
- All articles have a DOI
- The journal is not part of this [list of dubious publishers](https://web.archive.org/web/20170112125427/https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/)
- The content area of the journal is clearly described and the articles are in accordance with this description.
- The primary target group of the journal consists of researchers and scientific teachers and is mentioned on the website.
- The editorial board consists of renowned/well-known researchers from the discipline.
- The costs of publishing open access are clearly mentioned.
- The user licenses are clearly mentioned in each article
- You can also check the scoring of the journal [here](http://www.qoam.eu/journals)
