# Sharing research data: how?

Sharing data is becoming the golden standard in science. It enables others to reproduce your results and prevent fraud and honest mistakes in data analysis. Moreover, it enables reuse of your data in new analyses, increasing the impact of your work.

Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways:

## 1. Publish in a data repository

For example:

<ul>
    <li>The <a href=https://datarepository.eur.nl/>EUR Data Repository</a>: for publication packages at the EUR</li>
    <ul>
        <li>All data and materials accompanying a publication</li>
        <li>Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets or non-anonymous data</li>
        <li>See the <a href=pub-packages.html>publication packages page</a> for more information.</li>
    </ul>
<li><a href=https://dataverse.nl>DANS DataverseNL</a>: for publication packages at Leiden University</li>
<ul>
    <li>All data and materials accompanying a publication</li>
    <li>Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets (max zip file size 10GB) or non-anonymous data</li>
</ul>
<li><a href=https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/home>DANS EASY</a> (Dutch)</li>
<ul>
    <li>For data and materials, not necessarily accompanying a publication</li>
    <li>Has deals with the university but still some limitations to the size of the data (max. 100 GB)</li>
    <li>Is aimed more at archiving than sharing data</li>
</ul>
<li><a href=https://neurovault.org/>NeuroVault</a></li>
<ul>
    <li>For group-MRI data (such as t-maps) accompanying a publication</li>
    <li>Enables meta-analysis of fMRI-studies</li>
    <li>See the <a href=neurovault.md>NeuroVault page</a> for more information</li>
</ul>
<li><a href=https://osf.io/>Open Science Framework</a></li>
<ul>
    <li>max 5 GB per file</li>
    <li>Keep your data close to all other relevant files in your OSF project</li>
    <li>OSF is more aimed at project management than dissemination, read more here <a href=osf.md>here</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Other general-purpose repositories, such as <a href=https://zenodo.org/>Zenodo</a> (free up to 50GB), <a href=https://datadryad.org/>Dryad</a> (not free) or <a href=https://figshare.com/>Non-EUR Figshare</a> (free, max 20GB private space and 5GB per file)</li>
</ul>



In all cases, make your data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), see the [data management page](../data-management/FAIR.md) and take [privacy considerations](gdpr.md) into account.


## 2. Publish a datapaper

You can also publish a dataset in a data journal without the need to add it to a publication. In a datapaper, you describe the data and the methods of collecting them, without the need to analyze them. This will get you a publication out of your data irrespective of whether or not you publish results. This however often (but not always) requires that you make all described data public, because the aim of such publications is to provide access to high quality datasets and to facilitate reuse. Also, most journals have some policy in which repository you should deposit the data accompanying the datapaper. Note that a datapaper will be peer-reviewed just as well as a regular article. See [this link](https://pitt.libguides.com/findingdata/datajournals) for a list of data journals.


## 3. Via supplementary materials in a published paper

This is better than nothing, but not recommended, because this does not adhere to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Also, there is often a limit to the size or number of supplementary files that a journal can host, limiting the possibilities to publish data.

## 4. Share case-by-case

For data that cannot be shared publicly, you can sometimes still share the data case-by-case. This can be the case:



- For MRI-data for which you have informed consent from the participants to share. You may not want to publish this publicly because of the sensitive nature of the data, but you can still share the data because you have consent. Of course this also goes for other kinds of sensitive data for which you have consent.
- For data that does not belong to a publication, data that is too large to share in another way or some other reason

## Copyright & licences

**Copyright** includes the rights that you automatically get when you create something, such as an article or dataset (although there are differing opinions on whether or not data is the result of a creative endeavor). The copyright on a work will always be yours, except when you explicitly (partially) give it to someone else, such as a publisher.

With **licenses**, such as [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/?lang=en ), you specify what others are permitted to do with your product. You can see it as some kind of agreement: if someone violates the license, you have the right to sue them, just like a regular lawful agreement. For data, it is recommended to choose a CC0 (public domain) or CC-BY 4.0 license. These open licences both allow others to use the data without many restrictions. Note that this does not mean that your productdoes not have to be cited. You can simply state something like the following accompanying your licensing info: *“When using this [product, e.g., data], please cite the original publication: [citation]. Additionally, please cite the [name repository] package.”*
