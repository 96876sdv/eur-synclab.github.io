# Sharing research data: how?

Sharing data is becoming the golden standard in science. It enables others to reproduce your results and prevent fraud and honest mistakes in data analysis. Moreover, it enables reuse of your data in new analyses, increasing the impact of your work.

Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways:

## 1. Publish in a data repository

For example:
- The [EUR Data Repository](https://datarepository.eur.nl/): for publication packages at the EUR
  - All data and materials accompanying a publication
  - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets or non-anonymous data
  - See the [publication packages page](pub-packages.md) for more information.
- [DANS DataverseNL](https://dataverse.nl): for publication packages at Leiden University
 - All data and materials accompanying a publication
 - Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets (max zip file size 10 GB) or non-anonymous data
- [DANS EASY](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/home) (Dutch)
 - For data and materials, not necessarily accompanying a publication
 - Has deals with the university but still some limitations to the size of the data (max. 100 GB)
 - Is aimed more at archiving than sharing data
- [NeuroVault](https://neurovault.org/)
 - For group-MRI data (such as t-maps) accompanying a publication
 - Enables meta-analysis of fMRI-studies
 - See the [NeuroVault page](neurovault.md) for more information
- [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)
  - max. 5 GB per file
  - Keep your data close to all other relevant files in your OSF project
  - OSF is more aimed at project management than dissemination, read more [here](osf.md)
- Other general-purpose repositories, such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (free up to 50GB), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) (not free) or [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) (free, max 20GB private space and 5GB per file)

In all cases, make your data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and make sure the repository that you use has a long-term plan for saving the data.

## 2. Publishing a datapaper
You can also publish a dataset in a data journal without the need to add it to a publication. In a datapaper, you describe the data and the methods of collecting them, without the need to analyze them. This way you will get a publication out of your data irrespective of whether or not you publish results, increasing the impact of your research. However, it often requires that you make all described data public, because the aim of such publications is to provide access to high quality datasets and to facilitate reuse. Also, most journals have some policy in which repository you should deposit the data accompanying the datapaper. Note that a datapaper will be peer-reviewed just as well as a regular article.

## 3. Via supplementary materials in a published paper
This is better than nothing, but not recommended, because this does not adhere to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Also, there is often a limit to the size or number of supplementary files that a journal can host, limiting the possibilities to publish data.

## 4. Sharing case-by-case
For data that cannot be shared publicly, you can sometimes still share the data case-by-case. This can be the case:
- For MRI-data for which you have informed consent from the participants to share. You may not want to publish this publicly because of the sensitive nature of the data, but you can still share the data because you have consent. Of course this also goes for other kinds of sensitive data for which you have consent.
- For data that does not belong to a publication, data that is too large to share in another way or some other reason

### What you can do
- Use a data sharing agreement between you and the user of the data to make sure they will not try to identify your participants or do something else you don't want with the data
- Send data safely via SURF filetransfer, share it in SURFdrive or use another form of encryption before you send data files
