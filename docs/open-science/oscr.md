# Open Science Community Rotterdam

Interested in open science? Have a look at the [Open Science Community Rotterdam (OSCR)](https://openscience-rotterdam.com).

## OSCR workshops

For Open Science related topics, it is also an option to reach a broader audience and organise a workshop for the Open Science Community Rotterdam. All lab members can take part in these workshops as well, and other researchers can then also enjoy our expertise and experience.
See the [OSCR website](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/categories/news/) for a list of previous and upcoming workshops. Two lab members have already given a workshop:

- Eduard: Introduction to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), [workshop description](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/09/intro-bids-sept2020/)
- Dorien: Introduction to sharing brain MRI data, [workshop description](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/2020/10/sharing-mri-oct2020/)
