# Labmeetings

Currently (Summer 2020) Thursdays are labmeeting days:  
- 13.00h-14.00h Labmeeting  
- 16.00h-17.00h Skills meeting  

The current schedule can be found on [Research Drive](https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/7061266)

## Labmeetings

In the labmeetings labmembers share their latest results or ideas for new research. It is a great chance to get feedback in a supportive and welcoming environment. Labmeetings can also be used to practice a (conference) talk.
Collaborators from outside the SYNC lab are more than welcome for labmeetings where research from the specific collaboration is discussed. So do not forget to invite your collaborators when presenting!

## Skills meeting

The skills meeting is a one-hour opportunity to work on a diversity of skills that can be useful for a researcher. Labmembers can introduce information on a certain skill or topic or can help to dive deeper in a topic where most have already some experience with.
In this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RKIx5xdfvvjomPJ-rH_jyMNGn6oHWyi3PPTI0mwt6vk/edit#gid=0) we identified skills and topics:  
- labmembers have some experience or expertise  
- labmembers want to learn more about  

As you can see in the sheet, these skills can focus on methods, but also on personal and artistic topics. Ideally, we would work on topics that align with the ambitions of SYNC lab: _World-class Science, Open Science, Citizen Science_.

Since the skills meetings are only one hour a week, most of the times it would be just an introduction to a certain topic. It would be great to go from there and dive deeper in certain topics in smaller groups when interested (e.g., while working on a project together).
For topics where we have less expertise in the lab, it would also be an option to invite experts from outside the lab.

### Open Science Community Rotterdam workshops

For the Open Science related topics it is also an option to reach a broader audience and organise a workshop for the Open Science Community Rotterdam. All labmembers can take part in these workshops as well, and other researchers can then also enjoy our expertise and experience.
See the [OSCR website](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/categories/news/) for a list of previous and upcoming workshops. They currently are scheduled on Wednesdays at 14.00h, but this might be open for change (if preferred for your presentation).
